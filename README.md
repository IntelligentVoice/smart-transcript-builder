The other job is basically do what I did for them before and create some plain HTML their web designers can work with (see attached)

I did this with some manual hacking but if you can script it we will use this again

This time they want 8 of them created, for the 8 videos in https://comprindeo.intelligentvoice.com/JumpToWeb group 30 (Panel sessions)


The videos are numbered 30000000 to 30000007

The data to generate the transcript can be got from the API e.g.
https://jumpto_website:v64^MR7q$@comprindeo.intelligentvoice.com:8443/vrxServlet/ws/VRXService/vrxServlet/getDocument/30/1/30000001
or
https://jumpto_website:v64^MR7q$@comprindeo.intelligentvoice.com:8443/vrxServlet/ws/VRXService/vrxServlet/getDocument/30/1/30000007

and the videos themselves are on the webserver e.g.
https://comprindeo.intelligentvoice.com/JumpToWeb/sites/default/files/document_cache/30.30000002.30000002.mp4
or
https://comprindeo.intelligentvoice.com/JumpToWeb/sites/default/files/document_cache/30.30000007.30000007.mp4

if we get time it would be good if we can change the colours to match http://comprindeo.com and use this logo:

Ideally I would like to have something ready for tomorrow afternoon if we have time!

Hopefully thatâ€™s sort of clear, give me a shout if not.

Thanks
