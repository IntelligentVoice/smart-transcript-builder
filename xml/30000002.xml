You Know You Really Want To Go Hey Here's My Leverage Here's What I'm Bringing To The Table Because You're Basically Partnering Up With Labels Now So I I Just Think It's Uh A Completely Different World Now And When You Say We're More Like You Know The Label It's Like That's Why As A Consultant I Mean My Background Is In Marketing. Yeah But I I Worked With You Know As A Manager I Worked With Uh The Tubes For A Little Bit I Worked With Michael All That Really Coolidge Several Other Other Authors And So I Understand That But Now I'm Doing A Lot More Of Like What The Label Would Do Okay We've Got To Make Sure That We've Got All Or Marketing Square We've Got It You Know Everything Lined Up Properly In You Know If We're Going To Go To A Radio Who's The Right Radio Too Who's The Right Person For This Position So It's Sort Of Varies But Yeah It's I Don't Think It's The Same Way As You Know The Old Days When You Had You Know What It Whether Reserve Was Use Offered Any Other Top Lie Manager Men Different World When You're When You Read That I'm Like You Know That's Kind Of What Managers Do But They They Sort Of Oversee It They Don't They Don't Have The Fingers In Everything You Know I Have A Lot Of Team People That I Work With Whether It's A Producer Or Uh Digital Marketing Person Whoever It Is That I'm I'm Looking At The Big Picture That's Why I Was Really Interesting Watching. Berry In In They'll Talk About A Couple Of Things Because I Was Like Yeah But They Only Look At Their World As A Producer What They Need I'm Looking At It Going Well. Is That Right. If I've Got Uh If You Want To Go To The Radio If You're An Artist That Wants To Go To The Radio. I'm Going To Go To My Radio Promoters And Go What Do You Think Because You're The Guys On The Front Lines But That's A Different World From Like Were Alive Touring Band And That's Really What We Do Okay Or Let's Look At That World So That's Kinda How I Approach The Let Me Ask You Guys As Managers In Today's World Do You Think That We Have In The Last Five Years Dealing With Artists That We Have Redefined What Success Means Is That Is That Uh Is An Uh Definitely Okay Me Can You Talk About It When I Was Doing A In Our Gap In Records If You Didn't Sell A Hundred Thousand Or Two Hundred Thousand Records You Were Dropped And Now I Think That's A Huge Success C._n._n. Yeah Mhm Well Considering We Don't Sell Anything I Mean We Were Talking About This Yesterday We're In A Transitional Period And The Music Business Or The Record Business Where That's Actually Going Out I Mean It's It's What Are We Don't Now On The New Artists That Were Selling Anymore Our Vinyl Than You Know Over The Last Four Years But The Biggie You Know Was Also I Do It's It's It's A Niche Thing Yes It Went From Nothing In The Ashes To Now It's Three Per Cent Of The Market And The The Press Goes Wild Every Year Saying How It Has Gone Up A Hundred Percent Than Two Dozen Fourteen When Up Another Hundred And Fifty Percent It's Still Three Percent But You Know The Reality Is Is That We're In A Place Where We're Not Selling Anything Anymore I Mean That's That's The Interesting Part When You I Bet That That Has To Change Okay Ads Like Streaming As Like A Wreck There The Music Industry Completely That's Why I Support What Berries And You Know Ultimately But You Know Minimum Wage Is Higher Than Any Artist As Getting Paid On Streaming As Just Wrong Well Uh Go Ahead While I Was Going To Say Just From Being A Younger Manager The Doing This About Four Years I've Really Been At The Tip Of This Transition Yeah Dreaming Blew Up Very Much And I've Noticed That The The Funding The Money The The Earnings Are The Artists Is No Longer In The Downloads No Longer In The Streaming It's In The The Merchandising The Licensing Yeah And So One Of The Things That I Encourage Any Artist Who's Looking For A Manager To Do Is Find Some One Who Understands One That Any History They May Have Had As A Manager Five Years Ago Ten Years Ago It's Irrelevant Now That's Rate It Truly Is Irrelevant You Won A Manager Who Adapts With The Industry. The Biggest Executives Industry Couldn't Tell You Up From Down Right Now And That's Just The Reality Of It From A Lot Of My Work With They Come To Me Because I Run A Tour On The Side And I'm Like How Do You Do This I I Run A Multi Million Dollar Empire And I Don't Know What To Do And That's Just The Reality Of It So The Question Is What Can We Do As Managers Who Are Guiding Artists To Hone In On Something Unique About Them And Utilize Our Resources For Other Things That Are Acquiring Funds Such As Placements Such As Licensing Deals Such As Merchandise And Running Also The Promos Online And Tying Them To The Holiday Sales And You Know Keeping An Active Campaign So That The Artists Is Always On The Face Of Social Media But Not Necessarily Because Their Music The Music Is Not What's Making The Money Right Now. Yes Vin Placements I Remember Where You Could Get Ten Thousand Dollars Pretty Easily For A New Artist On A Placement Witches. And Now Yeah We We Just Did A Placement For A Film For One Of My Artists And It Was It It Was In The Thousands But It's Not Where It Used To Be So I I Believe That And Unfortunately Relate To It Yeah I Was I Was Gonna Say I Think It's Our Job As A Manager To To Sort Of Look At The Layer The Lyn I Rescued Complain About The Fact That Streaming Is In The Numbers And You Know The Bull Bull Crap That's Gone On Within The Industry. But I Can't Necessarily Do Anything About That So My Job Is To Sort Of Knew How Do We Maneuver Through This New Situation And Go Okay Well We're Not Making Money For You Know Again That's The Part Of The Reason Why I Said Why Don't Want To Be A Commission Will Manager Because There's Nothing The Commission Off Of So An Okay Well How Can I Make Money Still Give A Service To An Artist And I Started Looking At Like Well Okay Streaming Is One Thing But There's All These New Things That Were Doing For Artists Now Where You're You Know Maybe It's You're Doing Deals With Wineries Or Your Doing Some Sort Of Deal With With A Brand And There's A Lot Of Co Branding Can Branding In Sort Of The Big Word Now That You Know Everybody Wants To Use To Get Hooked Up With Some Other Brand Had Love To Be On Uh The Coca Cola Tour Or The Taco Bell Tour And Hooking Up With Various And There's All Those Kinds Of Things That Now We're Looking At They Might Be Much Smaller But It's Sort Of Like In The Publishing Industry The Publishing Industry Has Always Been A Nickel Business It's Been Pennies In Nickels And You Just Try To Find Ways To Build It Up So Have You Talked To A Publisher They Going To Go Well I'm Trying To License My Stuff More And Maybe It's With Film And T._v. And Maybe It's With Video Games And Maybe It's With You Too Been People Doing Weddings I Think Barry You've You've Got Something Going On That That Does Some Of That You Know And I Think That's That's What We Have To Do You're Right We Have To Change With The Changes But I Liked That Television Is Going To More Of An Indie Market That Much More Never Legs Who To Lose That Sort Of Thing They'll Be Like Young Supervisors And I Think New Bands Can Place Easier. Idea And I Think Eventually If You If You're An Artist Who Has A D._v._d. Or Something Like That Suddenly You Know You Don't Have To Go Through Is Many Doors To Get To To Maybe Get That Thing On Net Flicks We'll Get That Thing On Amazon I'd Really Those Huge Or Yeah Yup Yup Cable Subscriptions And Stuff And For Me Personally As Like I Still Have Satellite Television That I'm More Inclined To Watch Something On Net Flicks Because It Makes It You Know The Small Time That I Get To Watch Television As Like Is Not Usually On Mainstream Television For Me And I'd Have To Tape It And It's Like A House Oh At Least When That Flicks I Can Just Turn When I Want If We If We Can Just Get People To Binge Listen. Uh To An Album That Would Be Good Yeah I've Um. This Idea That There's There's And I'm Curious If You Guys Have Heard About This That I Hear This Term Alot Called Artistic Middle Class Which Refers To A Lot Of Artists That Don't Necessarily Have Record Deals Anymore. But They Are Touring They Are Making A Living They Don't Have Records On The Radio But Is This Is Something That You Feel Is Is Happening More And More Because I'm Seeing It From The Very You Know Hum. Brand New Artists Who Nobody's Ever Heard Of I Mean I've Met Like Three Or Four Of Them They're Not Nationally Known They They Have Records They Make Three Four Hundred Grand A Year Divided By Four Or Five People It's Not A Fortune But It's Enough For The Ban To Make A Living For Each Person To Live And Just Do Music Is This Something You Guys Are Seeing More And More Of In Your World Or Not I Think Is Just A New Term For A Long Tail Theory I Mean Okay Bands Skin Have Bans Are Artists Jimmy Buffett Well No No No I'm Not On The On The Famous Uh What Was That He Is Famous But He Was Never Are Grateful Dead For That Matter Yeah They'd Never Sold A Lot Of Records Never You You Worked At Nurse Or You Know That But They Had That Touring Said And I Think At Work And Make Lawyer Indie Bans And Rock Bands I Don't Think It Really Works For Pop Bands. And Indie Ban Can Go Out Into Our And Sell Tee Shirts. You Know They're Not Relying On Radio Or T._v. Plays Or Anything Like That So Go Ahead Sorry I've Got Some Friends That Are Rapidly Moving Up In The Underground Grungy Scene In Rock Scene And You The Dance Kevin Damp Dance Types Who Are Not Pushed Heavily By An R. Or Have An Infrastructure Around Them But They're Doing Half A Million Two Million A Year Just In Tori There Is A There Are Enough Loyal Fan Base That Follows That Community But They Are Not At All Expressed On The Mainstream Platform And I Think That There Regarding That Middle Class Artistic Avenue It It's It Is Something That A Lot Of These Bans Are Doing To Avoid Mainstream Because They Work And Spend Thousands And Thousands Of Dollars Just To Get To The Top Have A Label Take Seventy Percent Of Their Income If They're Fortunate And A Lot Of The Inner Booking Them And A Lot Of Them Are Booking Themselves And Instead They Have An Avenue Were Their Retaining Eighty Percent Mine Is A Booking Agent Know Fortieth If The Outta Manager Will Say Forty Percent Off The Top So They're Still Retaining Sixty Percent But They're Killing It Would Merchandise On Top Of It Which Is A Hundred Fold The Income You're Making Off The Streaming Downloads Do I Think The Middle Class Avenue Is Almost The Direction A Lot Of These Bans Are Taking 'cause They Don't Want To Be Sign Okay So Is It Your Recommendation I Mean Especially For A Lot Of Brand New Artists And We Have A Lot Of Artists Here From Many Different Styles In This Room That They Should Be Developing Merchandise Sales If They're Performing Right Away. Yeah I Did I Actually Think Hundred Percent I Think Is More Important That You Developing A Fan Base Not Just Developing Tee Shirts Right Yes So It's Really Important To Stick To You Know Again It's Like That Same Argument We Have About. The Digital World And Face Booking Hey I've Got Fifty Thousand Fans On This Or You Know If That's Not Translating. Yeah Yeah So I I Think But I Do Think That You Know The More You Can Get Rid Of Gatekeepers And Goes Iraq The Better And You Should Have Your Own Website I Mean I You Know I Think The Ban Camps And All That Stuff Are Great But You Want To Go Right To The Stores And Buy From Them And Keep In Touch With Them That's Been A Beep Them Wrong I Mean There's Nobody Taking Half Of It And The Audience You Don't Want To Ever Build Your Platform And Your Success On Someone Else's Plot From What Has Been A A Wedding Look At My Space Are Designed Living On Luggage A Lingers In The Rye Went Away Redefined Them So Yeah You Want To Build It On Your Own Website Speaking Of Which In In You Guys Is Mind Is Managers We Spoke About This Yesterday With Two Pros I'm Curious What Your Views Are In Terms Of Managing Artist How Important Is The Social Media Aspect To The Management Of Your Clients Or Of Their Own Careers In Your In Your Experience I Think It's Huge Okay Because I I Look At The Analytics Of Everything So That I Can You Know It's Not Just The Numbers But What's The Engagement. So There's I Think That's One Of The Great Things About Social Networking Is You Can Actually Get Information Back If You Do An Ad On On Google Or Wherever You Can Actually Get The Numbers Back You Know Get That From Doing An Ad In Some Magazine You Know I Don't Know I Think Face But Members Are Bullshit And People Buy Hits On You Know Five Or Or What Was Her You Know We'll Get Me Like Age Moment Though The Going To Tell You What's Really Happening While In That's This Is Something That I've Been Very Involved In As A Manager Is The Social Media Activity In My Artists And One Of My Artist Was Tops Six On The Ex Factor Season Once Or Her Social Media The Norm Us But Having A Million Followers Collectively On Social Media And Twenty Plus Million Views On You Tube May Translate To One Hundred Ticket Sales And New York And Five Ticket Sales In L._a. Or One Sale In Miami And Two Hundred North Dakota It's Very Hard To Gauge Where That Fan Base Is Located So Social Media Really For Me Is The Pitch To Get 'em In The Door It's For Me To Reach Out To An Agent And Say Look They've Got A Following Their Recognize They're Established Here's All The Media They Been Featured On In The Past Year They're Relevance Now Regarding How Many Tickets They Can Sell I Can't Guarantee That Right Now But What I Can Guarantee Is That If I Put You If You Put Your Artist On This Line Up With An Artist That Drawing Two Or Three Hundred I Can Get Her On Six T._v. Stations Right There And Do Some Extra Promotion For You So You Can Use The Social Media The Benefits Tours Not Necessarily The Utilizing Ticket Sales But By Utilizing Placements For Media Promotion Antiques Me It Seems Like It's Changed A Lot Because Card As Well It Is Really I Mean Sosa C._d. At This Point Yeah I Mean It's Like Even For My Book You Know It's Like It's A Calling Card I'm Getting Better Clients Coming To Me Because There's Something Out There With My Name On It And I've Done Touring But You Know For Social Media Like If You Did A Blog And You Are Liking Gauging With Your Fans All Day Long And Stuff I Think That Really Helps You Because They Wanna Feel Like They Know You You Know And Then One Of The The Interesting Jews Are Very Quick Story When I Was A Kid I Happen To Be Over There In My Ran The Rehearsal Studio So When I Was In There I Was Looking For My Friend Mario And I Said I Walk Up To This Guy Who Was Sitting There Playing Guitar Writing Songs Something And He Said Hey I'm Looking For In The Office Has To Go Over To The Office And I'm Talking To My Room Hey Who Is That Because Er That's Paul Stanley From Kiss And I Was Like Wow I Just Saw Paul Stanley Without As Makeup Because Back In The Day You Didn't Know Anything About An Artist Unless They Had A Record Coming Out And We Didn't Even Know What Those Guys Look Like In Real Life Nowadays We Want To Know What They've Had For Breakfast So It's Uh You Know That's Completely Turner And For A Lot Of The Old School Artist That I've Worked With They Have A Real Trout Real Problem With Having To Be So And On And There Is No Mystery Anymore And I Miss It You Can Build Another Led Led With The Like Sort Of. What You Call That Sort Of Thing Are It's A Different Era It's A Different Time In Those Areas You Know We Had Far Fewer Artists We Had Far Fewer Records We Had Four Fewer Labels The Biggest Label In The Business In That Era Had Thirty Five Artists On It Literally Warner Brothers Was The Largest Label In The Industry They Had Thirty Five Artists I Mean Literally It's Hard To Believe You Know A Label Like. Now I Think They Have What A Hundred And Sixty Eight Or Something Like That Yeah It's Just It's Been I Love You About How Many People Are Working Like When I Worked At There Were Two Hundred And Seventy Eight People There How Many Do You Think Are They Are Now Ten Yeah Yeah Well It's Been Merged With A. M. M. And Enter Scope And I Think The But There It's An Otherwise Yeah I Am I Shopped An Artist There Was Like No Music Being Played In The Building Which. Oh You Used To Walk In And There Were The Now They Every Office. And By The Way A Lot Of Those People That Were Working There Were Measles Or You Know And Now You Go In There There's A Lot Of Digital Guys Are There There Are People That Are Sort Of Not Necessarily In Love With Music But In Love With So There's A Lot Interns Working Social Media That's What You See A Room Like Five Or Six Kids. But Do You Know The Schools Or I'm Sorry Go Ahead Do While I Was Good In Mentioning Social Meet In Why Their Interns Working Social Media There Is More Opportunity For Each One Of The Artist Today Then There's Ever Been But There's Also A Bigger Barrier To Entry Because It's Gone From Exclusively Label Backed Artists To Have The Potential To Now Every Artist He's Got The Potential You Put Enough Money Behind Your Online Promotion And You Get Lucky And Have Some People That See You And Like You And Share. Face Book I Don't Know If You Guys Know This But Only Five Percent Of The People That Fall The You Actually See Each One Of Your Posts Unless You Promote It And There's Heavy Money That Goes Behind This Promotion And One Of The Things That You Need Needed A Manager Is Someone Who Understands The Dynamics Of Social Meter Which We Do Fortunately But Just Because You've Got A Hundred Thousand Followers And I Look At This When I'm Working With Artist Cool You Got A Hundred Thousand Followers How Much Have You Spent In The Last Six Months Promoting To Those Because As Far As I'm Concerned You Got A Hundred Thousand Followers Only Five Thousand Above Seen Any Of Your Both And Those Five Thousand Maybe In The Is It A Plot A Spot You're Never Going To Tour So It's Very Important To Understand The Dynamics Of The Social Media And Have A Campaign To Push Yourself Like A Label Would Which I've Ended Up Doing Dick Easily Ended Up Doing The Tat Yes It Is Very Important So That It Shows Up On Other Things I Give You Just Run A Picture On And You're Not Lake Hash Tagging Everything And Tagging Everything On The Picture No One's Going To See It But You And Your. Idiot But That's Because I Feel Like It's Taken A Bit Of A Negative Turn Here That You Guys Are All Damned Disney To Walk On The Car Right Now I'll Buy The Kleenex Don't Worry But That's Not Really Where We're At Social Media Is It's A Crutch More Than A Detriment Or More Than Uh You Know A Freebie A Lot Of The Artists That I Know Personally Have Very Small Social Media Followings Lines But Are Getting A Two Or Three Thousand Dollar Guarantee At Each Of Their Shows Because They're Drawing Three Hundred People Three Hundred And Fifty People Just Because The Following Isn't On Social Media Doesn't Mean The Fan Base Isn't There Some Keep That In Mind That You May Have A Thousand People But If You If There's A Venue That You Performed At Last Year That Says You Drew Three Hundred I Don't Care If You've Got To Followers On Face Book I'm Interested So We're Remember That That It Doesn't Define You It Helps You But It Doesn't Defining Develop In Your Own Back Yard Too You Know It's Like It's Like The Radius Gets Bigger And It's Like You're Here Do The Next Town Now The Next After That And Then Repeat Every Two Or Three Months You Know That's How You Build In Your Area Oh So One Of The Things That The Along Those Lines Mickey That That A Manager Mentioned To Me That A Lotta People Don't Do Is The Need For Music And Performance Things Within Their Own Community That Are Not In Clubs Like Doing Things For The City Like Doing Things I Can For Santa Monica They Have That A Huge Thing On The Pier Every Thursday Or Something It's Eight Bans Over A Course Book By The People That Are Run Go And The Echo Plex But It's A City Thing Rather Than Just A Club Thing In Other Words In Terms Of The Development I'm Just Trying To Like Come Up With Different Ways That We Can Talk About That People Can Develop Themselves It The Traditional But Being First That Things Like You Know Who's The Guy Mendez That Was On He Like He Made His Career I'm Being Like The First Guy On Vine That Was Getting Tons Of Hits You Now Have To Have It Be A Little Bit Ahead Of The Game And Think Of Something That You Can Do That No One Else Is Doing Like. A Friend Of Mine That Worked For You To Get Started A Virtual Reality Company And Board Is Doing And Virtual Reality Record Or Like How Beyond Say Did The Video Record I Mean Stuff Like That Is What Gets People's Attention I Used To Work With A Guy Who You Probably Don't Know Who He Is Named George Stolen And George Tobin Produced An Artist Named Tiffany So You Might Know About Tiffany And What George Did Was He Said We're Going To Do Mall Tours And Every Everybody Laughed At George And When You're Nuts And He Put Tiffany In All These Stupid Little Malls Across The Country Last A Country Doing Her Performances And That's What Blew Her Up And So I Write Predict Christian Bookstores I Was Like Oh We're Not Really Doing That Er I Kind Of Approach I Kind Of Try To Approach Things Sometimes Is I Called The White With The White Albums Syndrome Where I Look At It In The Midst Of Psych Adults In Nineteen Sixty Seven Sixty Eight The Beatles Came Out With The White Album So Amongst All This Color You See This What Album So What Do You Notice That White Album So Sometimes You Know Trying To Look At At The Way The Land And Going Or What Can I Do That Still Within The Confines Of What This Is But A Little Different Enough That It Can That I Can Own It Yeah I Think That's An Important Thing To Do So You Don't Just Become Another Ours Because As Doing Was Saying You Know The Barriers Of Entry Are So Low Now You're All Set The Best Thing About The Music Business Is Everybody In Their Brother Can Make A Record The Worst Thing About The Music Business Is Everybody And Their Brother Can Make A Make A Record So How Do You Get Yourself Above The Noise And Then I Think That's Really What What Are What We're Task To With Doing And Like Ten Years Ago The Biggest Class At U._c._l._a. Music Was An R. And Now It's A Marketing I Mean Kids Are Waking Up You Have To Figure Out How To Market Your Um Records. Let's Talk About Some Of The Other Things Outside Of The U. S. And I'm Curious If You Feel Is International Or Touring Bands Internationally A Touring Artists Internationally A Viable Option For X. Who Are Starting Their Careers I Hear. Different Things From Different Managers What's Your Sense Of This Way To Sort Of Depends I've Worked With Jazz Artists In For Jazz Artists They Can Go To Japan They Can Go To Germany They're Sort Of You Know There's Ways That They Can Go Out There Grab A Few Musicians And Perform Out There And Sort Of Build Something Out Um I Think It's Sort Of Depends On The Genre It Might Be A Lot Tougher For A Country Artist To Go To Japan Build A Build A Fan Base So And You Can Trade Up With Artists I Mean That's What I'm Trying To Do It's Like I Just Went To The U. K. So I At A Bunch Of Bands From The U._k. I'll Trade Them Out To Come To The U. S. The Take My Art Is With Them Around The U. K. Yeah And I'm In They Pop E. D. M. World Which Is Eighty Percent International Yummy The U. S. Has Got A Huge E. D. M. World No Question About That But A Lot Of The Music I Do Uh Grows In The European Industry Its Way Back To The U. S. Market So Regarding Features I Mean My Artist We Just Uh Just Completed Too Tracks With Israeli D Jays That Blaster Jackson We're Going To Be Working With In Israel You Know So It's In That Commit Expand From There To Europe So From An E. A._t._m. M. Respect You Can Blow Up Internationally Without Ever Having To Leave The Country Regarding Touring It's Brutally Expensive As An Artist Unless You're Unless You're Backed Unless You Got Mom And Dad And If You Do God Bless You. Keep That Don't Pissed Them Off Use It As Much As You Can Cause You're Going To Need It Yes They Is As Long As You Are Putting Yourself On A Platform With An Artist I Was Going To Cater To Your Sounds And It's Going To Give You An Opportunity Did Expose Yourself A Lotta These Stores You Throw Your Cell Phone You Gotta You Know A Fifteen Minute Window You Perform Your Offs Stays The Chance Are You Getting A Meeting Greatest Slim To Denying You Don't Really Get To Bring Much Merchandise Because That's Six Hundred Dollars In Luggage Access So The Opportunities There But What I Recommend It Off The Bat For Someone Who's Growing Now I Would I Would Do It Vicky Talked About Starting Your Community Build A Fan Base Built Family That Love You Build A Core Of Thirty Or Forty People That Say Absolutely Be At Every Show Than You Can Go To Three Than Using Sale Self Forty Tickets And Each One Of These Venues For Sure Than It Grows From There Then You Expand Once You Expanded He Got A Name Then I Think International As A Viable Option For You Know The Other Thing You Can Do In Your Building The Market Is Good With Other Artists No Your Order Something In Your Community And Go Hey Let's Let's Take Three Or Four Of Us Go To A Promoter Or A Club And Say That We Want A Night Because That Way They Don't Have To Sit There And Figure Out Who Who Else Do I Need To Get On This Bill And If You Can Go We've Got Three People You're Sharing Off Of Each Other's Fan Bases You're You're Using Each Other. I Just Think That's A Really Great Cause Use Your Community Be Smart About It Too You Don't Play Over Player Town Like Two Times In A Month As Plenty And If You Don't Draw Fully Me Promoters Or Going To Remember That I Promoted Night And It's Like If You Don't Draw For Me Or Not Coming Back So. You Know All Of You've Been Managers For A Long Time And You Obviously Had A Lot Of Acts Come To You Wanting Management You Obviously Haven't Taken Every Single Act There's Obviously Been A Lot Of Talented Acts That Have Come To You That You've Passed On For Various Reasons What I'd Like To Get From Each Of You Is What Is It That You Look For Beyond Music I Mean Yeah There's Talented People But There's Also A Lot Of Other Of These Either Unspoken Or Intangible Factors That Make You Say Yes To A Client When You Said No To The Previous Forty That Said Vicky Manage Me Or Dylan Manage Manage Manage Me Can You Talk About This Because I I Think It's Important For People To Understand What It Is You Look For I Call It The It Factor I Don't Know What It Is Exactly But I Know It When I See It And It Starts With Great Songs And Then It Goes To The Artists Has To Wanna Work As Hard If Not Harder Than Me And. That They Have Something New Indifferent And I And I'm Really A Fan Of Bands That Have Something To Say Or Have A Cause That There Is You Know We Can Identity Walk Into Like A Er A Label Or Marketing Company The First Thing They Say Is What's The Story So You Better Figure Out What The Story For You Even Walk In There. Okay My Approaches A Little Different Again Because I Consult So It's Not A Requirement That They Had To Be Uh You Know So If They Don't Have Great Songs But I Can Put Them Them Together With The Producer In In A Writer That Has Great Songs So I'll I'll Tell You My Very First Thing Is Don't Be An Asshole Because I I'm At The Point In My Life Where I Just Don't Want To Deal With Crab I Want That I'll Stay Home With My Kids So It's Really Important For Me That That People Also Have A Very Good Grasp On Expectations Because A Lot Of Times We're We're Doing Is Were Managing A Expectations Of An Artist Or Something Like That But I Do Look For You Know How Talented They Are I Look At You Know Where Their Resources What Are They Have To Work With Um. You Know For Me It's I'm Not Going To Just Take Anybody If They Suck Because You Know When I Go Out I Have To Represent That Artists They're Representing Me And I Still Have To Be Able To Sell That To Someone Who Won Dealing With And If They Suck That Guy's Not Going To Take My Call Anymore So I've I've Gotta Make Sure That If I'm You Know Working An Artist That They've They've Got A Basis Of Some Pretty Good Talent But I Don't Mind How Rod Is Okay Dylan I'm Going To Dig Deep Here. One Of The Reasons I Became A Manager Is Because I Hate The Music Industry I Hate The Way Artists Are Treated I Hate How Snooty And Snobby An With The Exception Of The People That Are Part Of This Organization They Are One Of. Uh Doesn't You Know That Actually Have Been Worth My Time In This Industry And I Work With All Sorts Of Execs And Know All Sorts Of Execs And That's Just A Pain In The Ass They Really Are And One Of The Reasons That I Decided To Manage Was Because I've Seen Too Many Acts That I Believe In Personally That Have Got Incredible Gifts And Incredible Talents But Just Don't Know How To Capitalize On It Right A Lot Of Managers Won't Even Talk To An Artist Unless They're Making Three Hundred Thousand Dollars A Year Which You Know Translates To Sixty Thousand Dollar Commission In They For A Manager Which Most Top Blunt Managers Do Unless You Have An Income Respect In As Hard As We Work I'm Just Gonna Say We're Entitled To That But It Doesn't Mean We Make Our Decisions Based Upon It So One Of The Things That I Did To Distinguish Myself As A Manager Is All Of The Different Assets You'd Have To Pay For Is An Artist Graphics Videos Design Social Media Promotion Web Sites I Spent Years Studying Noodle So I Do At All Personally For My Artists I Do A Lot Of That Is You Understand So What I Look For In An Artist Is Not Necessarily Some One Who Is Ready Tomorrow To Make Three Hundred Thousand Dollars A Year But Some One Who If I Put All The Time That I'm Willing To Put In Willison We'll Let Me Coach Will Let Me Lead Will Let Me Resource All The Relationships I've Built And We'll Sit Down With Me And Say I Don't Know What To Do Here Can You Help Me And Me Say To Them Who Have You Worked With Over The Past Few Years That I May Not Know Yet Let Me Rebuild Those Relationships For You I've Had Several Artists That Came To Me From Reality T. V. And They Worked With The Biggest Producers The Biggest Agents And Due To Poor Management Off The Show All Of Those Relationships Were Tarnished So I Said Let Me Rebuild Those For You And Now We're Back In The Studio Into Doing Movies In Huge Project With Them So A Manager Is Not Someone Who You Just Pick Up The Phone And Say Hey I Need A Show That's Not What A Manager Does A Manager Literally Becomes Your Partner Mhm And They Become A Percentage Of Your Project And Unless You Find A Manager Who Is Willing To Say Right Now That I'm Not Going To Make Money Off Of You For The Next Year But I'm Willing To Put In Sixty Thousand Dollars A Work Because I Believe You Will Then You Found Yourself A Manager And Those Are Hard To Find Today You Guys Both Mentioned The The Aspect Of The Uh Work Ethic And I Heard Uh Who Who's There Visit There Is A Great Quote From Mandy That's What I Was Just Going To Say I Which You Said Vicky Uh While I Was I Was Sitting There Having A Conversation With Them And He Goes You Know Don't Work Harder Than Never When At In Your Art As Young As If That's The Case Of That's The Reality It's Not Going To Work On The Same Thing You Want It More Than They Do It Over If You're Dealing With The I I Do A Lot Of Work With Kids Who The Parents Are Financing Things And Sometimes At The Look At The Parents Go I Think You Want This More Than Your Kid Does. Very Dangerous Because You Push It Do You Do You Look For That Kind Of Work Ethic Do You Look For That Kind Of Personality Or Different Personality Traits In In The People Get Their I Mean I've Known I've Known A In Our People Who Are Passed On Who Went On To Be Very Successful Artists Because Of That Because They Said I Could Never Work With This Person Because This Person Either Has A Bad Work Ethic Is Not Driven Or Whatever They Didn't Go On To Have Success But They They Knew They Knew And I've From Your Point Is A Band In L._a. Who I Absolutely Love Them And I Cannot Get Them Agree On Anything With Me So Now I'm Just I've Kinda Lost Interest Like Why Do I Wanna Put My Time And You Don't You Don't And I I Also Am Hired As A Consultant A Lot And I Think That's A Really Good Way To Know Whether You're Gonna Like That Artist Or Not Like That Artist They Give You Like A Dating Period I've Worked Artist That You Know When You Come In To Start Working With Them They Come And Act Like Okay My Job Is Done Now You Take Over And Deal With All This Stuff And He's Like No No No No No Not That You're Asking A Team Of People To Get Behind You You Better Work Harder Than Ever You Know To To Keep These People Involved I Had To Drop A Couple Artists In The Past Year Because I Spent That Sixty Thousand Dollars Worth Of Time And They Were Incredibly Gifted One Couldn't Get Along With The Ban Members Went To Free Bands Why Took That Long To Drop Em I Don't Know But They Had The It Factor And Because A Personal Differences They Blew It But The Thing That I Watch Out For As A Manager Is When This Artist Had An Opportunity To Perform On Huge Shows And Join Huge Tours And It Didn't Happen Because Of His Personal Differences He Called Me And Said I'm Tired Of Your Mistakes Affecting My Career And Blamed To Me. Yeah So Sounds Like A Manager And That We're Used To That By Today's Age Because We're Not Sane Immediately Let's Go Get Signed I When I Signed My Artists Last Year Who I Work With Currently I Said For One Year We're Not Eating At A Talked About Labels We're Not Going To Think About Labels We're Not Going To Do Anything Label Related We're Going To Re Brand You Reposition You Get You On Our Get You On T._v. Get You Some Radio When We've Done All Of That And Now All Of A Sudden They Both Levels Are Knocking Out The Door So Make Sure That That Artist From My Perspective Worked As Hard As You Do In That That's Absolutely And I I'm Glad You Said That Or Harder Or Heart Preferably Harder But I Am I Met The Position Now And I Think Is The Young Manager When You First Answer You're Willing To Take Anything You Can Get But After Being Burned Enough Time Than Working With An Enough Artists You Realize Very Quickly The The Artist Your Science In How Valuable Your Time Is How How Is N._y. N._y._u.

Vicki You've Dealt With A Lot Of Artists That Right There On Material. Is That Something That You Look For In An Artist Day We're I I Know Manage It There Is Some Managers I Know Who Say I Only Want To Work With Artists Who Are Self Contained What's Your View On That As Opposed To Getting You Know I Know A Lotta Trivia Fans And They're Making Probably More Money Than The Original Vans But You Know I'm All About The Art Form Right I Was Sitting In This Venue In Ireland Where This Chick Was Doing Caring Carpenter Records And They Paid Forty Dollars A Ticket And There Were Fit Hundred People In There And I Started Doing The Math In My Head I Was Like I'm In Where She Good She Was Really Good Yeah Yeah No She Didn't Play Drums But She Saying It Perfectly. And She's Played That That Venue At Least Eight Or Nine Times So That's Like A Big Chunk Of Cash Okay. And She Wants To Come To America And You Know I'm Like Thinking How Can I Make That Work There Right Not What I Do So I You Know How To Do That I Am All About Developing Artist Having Original Of Career Yeah I Agree With Vicky On This That You Know For Me I Just Went Through A Process With One Of Our Artist We're I Said To The We All Right And I Was Like Okay Everybody Here Rights We Can All Summit Songs But We're Going To Have A Consensus That Everybody Is We're Going To Pick The Three Songs That We're Going To Record We're Going To Pull In The Best Outside Songs Wherever We Get Them In And Sit Down And Determine What Are The Best Songs For This Artist For Moving This Artist Lord And We All Pitched Songs In None Of Our Songs Got Accepted We Decided On The Three Outside Songs That Were Just Better Sons Because For Me I Do Can You Know Being A Song Writer For So Long I Consider Myself A Bit Of A Song Nazi I Love Great Songs So That's You Know That To Me As A Starting Point You've Got To Have A Great Song In A Great Voice To To Deliver That Stuff And As An Artist Your New Song Is Not Always Your Best And You Know When You Get Involved With A Manager A Publisher Whatever Play Them Every Thing Because Maybe A Song You Wrote Five Years Ago As Something That Like Works For Them In Their Mind. Let's Uh Open It Up Two Questions From You Guys Please Come On Up And Uh Yeah. Come On Up And Ask Away. The Er And. Hello. Uh-huh. Um I Have A Child That Is A Singer And Um. I Love A Hearing Everything Because I Just Try And Apply It To What We're Doing Um I Think Oh We're Running Into Is We've Had People Approach As For Management And Stuff Like That Um But The Flake Of Meter What Um What Can We Do To Avoid That Wetter Tall Tale Signs I Mean I Have My Opinion It Out But I'd Love From The Pros The Know Stay Away From This Avoid This When They If They Say This Those Sort Of Key Thing Here's Something I Run Into Because I'm A Fee Based Consult And I Get Paid On A Monthly Basis For A Period Of Whatever The Case Is So I Run Into The Thing Of Like Hey We Paid This Guy Ten Thousand Dollars A Month And Then We Had To Pay Another Hundred Thousand Dollars Over This List And I I Would Look At A At A While Some Some Of Those Numbers Seem A Little Exhaust For Them So It's You Know If Somebody Tells You You Should Never Pay A Manager I'm A Consultant And I'm Not Really A Manager I Worked With Managers As Well But Sometimes I Sort Of Step In An Act As A Man Teacher But I I Disagree With That I Think You Can Pay For People For For Services But You Have To Look At What's Reasonable And Probably One Of The Easiest Things To Do Is If Somebody's Approaching You Find Out Who Else I've Worked With And Say Hey Can I Get Some Numbers Can I Call Some People Go On Line Check Them Out Try And Try Really Do Your Due Diligence On Who These People Are How Legit They Are Uh You Get If They're If They're Bullshit You Can Probably Go On To Google And Put Their Name In There And At Least Five Or Six Things Will Come Up Boom Taylor Ended Up In Billboard Magazine Because Someone Faked It And It Turned Out Fifteen Years Prior Similar With The Same Name And Molested Two Thirteen Year Olds Yes I Mean That's That's Why We're Really Hyper It Might Be An Interesting Situation You Want To Get Well One Of The Things I've Always Said And I Can Attest To The People Here Springboard Is These Are Some Of The Most Successful People But They're Also Some Of The Most Humble You Have To Ask Them Questions About What They've Done To Get It Out Of Them The Managers And The People In A Are That I Stay Away From Our The People Who Walk In High I'm So And So Here's What I've Done They Talk For Ten Minutes And You Don't Get A Word In If They're Really Interested In Your Daughter They're Going To Ask You Questions They're Going To Focus On You They're Going To Text You They're Going To Pastor You They're Going To Try To Stay Number One On Your List And A Lotta Managers They Just Because They're Not As Busy As They Used To Be Because This Industry Is So Uh Open To Every One They Want To Say Oh I Had A Meeting With This Artist Or Oh I Talked To This Artist So That They Can Go Drink At A Bar And Brag That Are Friends Let's What I See All The Time Make Sure That They Work For You Okay Now Do Do Like Uh Grace Period Of A Couple A Months I Mean I Will Now It's Like If I Love Something Now Hang On For About Three Months Without A Contract But I Make Them Pay Me For Those Three Months You Know Yeah That's That's What I Just Watch For It Because I I'd Be Willing To Bet Your Daughter's Not Make Amount Of Money Uh Yeah So No Manager Really Is Looking To Capitalize On Her Right This Second They're Not It's Not An Instant Pace Back Though If It's Someone That's Really Focused On Developing Her Then They're Someone Who's Going To Give You A Price Because They Know What They're Worth And They're Going To Let You Pay The Monthly On A Retainer And Say Here's What I'll Do For You I'll Do It For Six Months And Then We'll See Wishes That Then I'll Sign Or To Management So Make Sure That They Know They're Worth First Because That's That's Important Thinking. Come On Up By The Way One Of The Things I Was Going To Say About Um When You're Involved In Consulting Or Management As I Called The Ex Boyfriends Syndrome Because We'll Get In The Situations Where In This Happens A Lot When I'm Dealing With The The Young Kids Whose Parents Are Financing Something And They've Gotten Completely Ripped Off From The Last Guy Who Gave Him A Load Of B._s. And That Right Away They're Looking At You And I It's Like The Ex Boyfriends Syndrome Is I Know Your Last Boyfriend Be Chew On Not Your Last Boyfriend And I'm Not Going To Beat You So We Have That Battle Going Into Some Of These Relationships That The Last Guy Screwed Them Or The Last Several Guys Screwed Them And Whoop We're Trying To Figure Out A Way Of Diffusing That Yeah. So Um I Just Kind Of Want To Get Your Opinion On Something It's Kind Of War It's A Little Bit Of A Question But I Mean I Like Being In Rocking It's A Little Bit Different I Found With You Know A Lot Of Like Management Kind Of Already Expect You To Have Like A Fan Base Already But I Also Find That Also Being In A Rock Band As Well It Kind Of Takes Management To Get Into Venues It Actually Do Anything For You Um Maybe That's Just Like In The L._a. Kind Of Area But You Can Only Like Really That Kind Of Small Menus And Things Like That And If You Want To Open Up Are Bigger Band They Kind Of Expect You To Like Have Like Some Kind Of Management To Get You On That Bill So I Was Just Wondering Like What Kind Of Advice You Have For That Like Would It Be Like With Playing Like Just The Kind Of Like You Said Like The Same Place That Has Like A Good Fan Base I Kind Of Consistently Like Spread Out Or What Would You Really Right Now You Get On The On The Radar Of Uh Uh A Bigger Club You Know The You Know During The Coach House Or Something Like That New You're In The San Diego Or L._a. Area The Might Be Open To You Even Though You Don't Have Management To Opening To Opening Slots It's Not Required To Have A Manager To Get That's Right I Know A Pretty Girl Like You Have Some Friends You Know You Have Somebody That Walleye Pose As A Manager For You I Mean Right You Know Sometimes The Best Person For The Job Is Not The One With The Most Experience But The So And I'd Like To Totally Again That's Part Of What I Do Is Not To You Know Blow My Horn But I Consult With A Lot Of Ours That Eventually I'm Like Okay Now I Think You're Ready For A Manager And If You Remember That Movie That Thing You Do With Tom Hanks Remember The Guy Who Took The Band And Said I Love You Guys But Now I'm Going To Take You Over The Tom Hanks And Your He's Going To Be The Guy That's Going To Take A National That There Are People Out There To Do That You Know And I I Consider Myself Sort Of One Of Those Like Not Really Interested In Becoming A Fulltime Manager Anymore I Did It I Don't Want To Do It But I'll Certainly Help Help You Get Ready In At Some Point When You're Ready To Move Over To To A Vicky Or Dylan Rock On And I'm There To Support You In Public You've If It's There They're Moving There To Work With Everyone And To Get Better Gigs Those Bands That You Admire Love Getting Real Letters Saying I Love Your Record In It Would Be Every Thing For Me To Open For You And You Can I Buy You Lunch Sure Yeah The Home At In In In In The Whole You Know The Bin Relationships Then You Have To Like Work It That Way But I I Would Venture To Say That Your World Is Almost Easier Than The Properly Rock Absolutely In Some Of My Best Friends Are Rock Musicians And They Play More Excited Racist. They Play. Of All Colors They're Um They Play More Shows Without A Manager Than The Artists I Know Who Had Manager Because They Are Close To Booking Agents And They're Close To Venues What You Need To Do Is Walk Up To A Venue In Your Town Say I'm So And So I Can Bring You Twenty People No Questions Asked I Don't Care If It's Your Sister Your Adopted Family Your Grandparents They Don't Know They Just See Twenty Ticket Sales Go Up The Venue Say This Is Me If You've Got An Open It's Lot Coming Through That's Looking To Fill Twenty Spots I Can Do It Get Your Name On Each Of The Venues Meet A Local Booking Agents You Don't Need A Manager For That They're Everyone Reaching Contact All The Booking Agencies In Your Area And Say I'm So And So I Can Do A Twenty Ticket Minimum They've Got A Sheet Of Bands And They'll Say We Need To Fill Twenty Tickets Okay Well They're On Outlets Call Her So You Don't Even Need A Manager In L._a. You're In L._a. Where In Long Beach So Tend To Play Like The L._a. Area But. Uh-huh. Company That Sends Out A Newsletter Lots. Oh Okay In Return Do You Have A Really Good Do You Have Any Um Yeah Okay So Put Your Draw On It Okay I Get It Out To All The Okay That's I Don't Even Look For A Manager Quite Yet Yeah Looking To Hire Someone To Develop Like Us That's Different But If You're Looking For A Manager You Don't Need That To Play Shows Matters Are Going To Come To You Into Your Plane Shows They Want To See You Do The Work Right Actually Easier To Do Than You Think Most People Are Willing To Do It You See All These People They're Plane Shows Yeah They're They're Ten Percent Of The People That Have Actually Work To Do It Totally Be In That Ten Percent. Uh-huh. Yes. And I I Think I Could Say For Everyone Here That We Actually Catered Artists Who Do The Work So Email From You I'm Going To Be More Inclined To Reach Out To You First Than To Go Find Someone To Fill The Spot. Thank You. Not The Lead Singer. Alright So I Think You Has Kind Of Asked The Question But It You Know I My Background I Came From You Know Inner Scope Universal And Grow Group And We Had Managers Who Didn't Really Necessarily Cater To Us It Was Like You Know Just Kind Of What We Were Doing So Wasn't Necessary A Lot Of It Wasn't The Best Situation Like By And Then So Ends And Then Uh You Know I Try To Seek Out Independent Managers That People Like They Talk And They They Say That They Know People And And Then I Got Screwed Over That And How To Like Chill Out For Like A Year And Half Because Of The Contract With A Year And A Half Two Years So I'm Kinda In The Situation Where I've Gotten A Lot Of Work Done By Myself In With My Family And That's Why You Know I'm Here In Like I'm Doing A Lot Of Things In A Sense But I Guess My Question Is Is Like What Would You Suggest Like For An Artist In My Position That Has Still Kind Of A Little Bit Of You Know Because We Are I Came From A Pretty Big Platform And And Most Of The Canadian Ties Like Who Has Uh A Little Bit Of A Fan Base But I Don't Necessarily Have The Networks And Resources As A Big Time Manager Or Somebody Who's More Connected In The Industry Like American I Think It's A Lot Of Other Things About Leverage So If If Are You A Tour Or You Will Do You Mostly A Recording Act Ah Live I Mean I'm Just Like My I Just Record My Like A Few Months Ago And I'm Starting To Get Out Because Life Shows Solo Yes So Did To Track Solar To Track Or Ben Okay And Dancers Salem Like Uh I Would Just Say You Know If The Managers Not Dare Do Would They Would Do So A Booking Agent Isn't There Get Up In Book You Going To Have To Set Aside Party Or Day It's A Job You Know It's Not Just The Creative Part Is Great We All Dig Being Creative. When You Have Something You Have To Deal With The Business Part That's The Part You Kind Of Have To Be You Know There Were All Talking About The Artist We Love Is The Guy Who's Gonna Screw It I'm Getting A Gig You Know So You Really Sort Of Have You Can't Say One I'll Just Wait Till I Get A Manager Because You Know A Year Goes By And All Of A Sudden You're Value Goes Down You Know The People Have A Short Memory Out There. And Clubs That You Wanna Play And Find Out Who's Playing There And Reach Out To The Artist And Say I Wanna Open For You Works Too And It's The Manager Relationships That I've Seen Are Kind Of Divine Appointments And A Lot Of Ways Like They Meet Accidentally Or Are They See Each Other At A Convention Or They Happen To Be Having A Drink With The Body And They See This Person On Stage It Just Happens By Chance Or Divine Appointments So Don't Rely On The Manager If For Just From A A Bird's Eye View If I Saw An Artist Sane To A Panel A Managers I Don't Know What To Do 'cause I Don't Have A Manager Anymore I'm An Or Run I Want An Artist That Says I'm Pissed At These Managers Drop Me I'm An Echo Show 'em What I'm Capable Of And I'm Going To Sign On And Say Our Abby Let's Do It Yeah That's Exactly What I'm In The Those Are The Shoes That I've I've Had I've Learned Some Uh Have Become My Own Manage It Really You Know And So I'm Running My Own Business In A Sense Like That's How I Look At It A Natural Tendency Of Any Right Now The Natural Tendency Of Any Person Is To Go With The Path Of Least Resistance So If If It Means That You're Already Doing Stuff And All I'm Doing Is Stepping In To Pull You Up To A Higher Level That's A Lot Easier Than Going In Going Okay We've We've Done Nothing And We're Doing Nothing And Waiting For You To Do It All That's Totally Correct Because I Was Like The Position I Came From Literally Like You Know How The Record Labels Develops You And They Came From The Situation Where They Literally Did Everything For Me Like Or For The Group That I Was In Like A Girl Grew It Was Yeah You're From Gaffe An Ad I Was On He Was Our Executive Producer They Know More I Hear That Name I Know What Kind Of Group Yeah It Was Uh Robyn And You Know The Whole These Issues You Know Well They I've Grown Up Now And I'm Going To Have My Own Career I Don't Know How To Do A Girl That's How That's How That With The Position That I'm In And Right Now So It's A It's Very Uplifting And It's Great And I Feel You Know That My Time In A Sense Coming You Know To Be Really Doing A Lot As A Solo Artist And You Know I'd Have To Take You Know My I Had To Take The The Reins Of My Own Career And Last Year That's How I Figured It Out And I Was Like I'm Going To Just You Know You Know Do My Opie And Pay Off Who I Need To And And You Know Do It That Way And Do The Music Videos Because I Literally Had A Hands On Experience And It's Hard To Get A Hands On It Like Uh Experience In The Music Industry When You're You So We're A Pretty Big Artist While He He Was In A Band That He Was In A Band That Was Huge Okay Sorry For Cats Are Real Quick I Work At This Band That Was In A Bare He Used To Go To Go Want Just The Guitar Player And I'm Like Hey It's A Whole New World You Can't Just Be The Guitar Player Anymore.

<p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: You Know You Really Want To Go Hey Here's My Leverage Here's What I'm Bringing To The Table Because You're Basically Partnering Up With Labels Now So I I Just Think It's Uh A Completely Different World Now And When You Say We're More Like You Know The Label It's Like That's Why As A Consultant I Mean My Background Is In Marketing. Yeah But I I Worked With You Know As A Manager I Worked With Uh The Tubes For A Little Bit I Worked With Michael All That Really Coolidge Several Other Other Authors And So I Understand That But Now I'm Doing A Lot More Of Like What The Label Would Do Okay We've Got To Make Sure That We've Got All Or Marketing Square We've Got It You Know Everything Lined Up Properly In You Know If We're Going To Go To A Radio Who's The Right Radio Too Who's The Right Person For This Position So It's Sort Of Varies But Yeah It's I Don't Think It's The Same Way As You Know The Old Days When You Had You Know What It Whether Reserve Was Use Offered Any Other Top Lie Manager Men Different World When You're When You Read That I'm Like You Know That's Kind Of What Managers Do But They They Sort Of Oversee It They Don't They Don't Have The Fingers In Everything You Know I Have A Lot Of Team People That I Work With Whether It's A Producer Or Uh Digital Marketing Person Whoever It Is That I'm I'm Looking At The Big Picture That's Why I Was Really Interesting Watching. Berry In In They'll Talk About A Couple Of Things Because I Was Like Yeah But They Only Look At Their World As A Producer What They Need I'm Looking At It Going Well. Is That Right. If I've Got Uh If You Want To Go To The Radio If You're An Artist That Wants To Go To The Radio. I'm Going To Go To My Radio Promoters And Go What Do You Think Because You're The Guys On The Front Lines But That's A Different World From Like Were Alive Touring Band And That's Really What We Do Okay Or Let's Look At That World So That's Kinda How I Approach </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: The Let Me Ask You Guys As Managers In Today's World Do You Think That We Have In The Last Five Years Dealing With Artists That We Have Redefined What Success Means Is That Is That Uh Is An Uh </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: Definitely Okay Me Can You Talk About It </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: When I Was Doing A In Our Gap In Records If You Didn't Sell A Hundred Thousand Or Two Hundred Thousand Records You Were Dropped And Now I Think That's A Huge Success C._n._n. Yeah Mhm </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: Well Considering We Don't Sell Anything I Mean We Were Talking About This Yesterday We're In A Transitional Period And The Music Business Or The Record Business Where That's Actually Going Out I Mean It's It's What Are </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: We Don't Now On The New Artists That Were Selling Anymore Our </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: Vinyl Than You Know Over The Last Four </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: Years But The Biggie You Know Was Also I Do It's It's It's A Niche Thing Yes It Went From Nothing In The Ashes To Now It's Three Per Cent Of The Market And The The Press Goes Wild Every Year Saying How It Has Gone Up A Hundred Percent Than Two Dozen Fourteen When Up Another Hundred And Fifty Percent It's Still Three Percent But You Know The Reality Is Is That We're In A Place Where We're Not Selling Anything Anymore I Mean That's That's The Interesting Part </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 5: When You I Bet That That Has To Change </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: Okay Ads Like Streaming As Like A Wreck There </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: The Music Industry Completely That's Why I Support What Berries And You Know Ultimately But You Know Minimum Wage Is Higher Than Any Artist As Getting Paid On Streaming As Just Wrong </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: Well Uh Go Ahead While I Was Going To Say Just From Being A Younger Manager The Doing This About Four Years I've Really Been At The Tip Of This Transition Yeah Dreaming Blew Up Very Much And I've Noticed That The The Funding The Money The The Earnings Are The Artists Is No Longer In The Downloads No Longer In The Streaming It's In The The Merchandising The Licensing Yeah And So One Of The Things That I Encourage Any Artist Who's Looking For A Manager To Do Is Find Some One Who Understands One That Any History They May Have Had As A Manager Five Years Ago Ten Years Ago It's Irrelevant Now That's Rate It Truly Is Irrelevant You Won A Manager Who Adapts With The Industry. The Biggest Executives Industry Couldn't Tell You Up From Down Right Now And That's Just The Reality Of It From A Lot Of My Work With They Come To Me Because I Run A Tour On The Side And I'm Like How Do You Do This I I Run A Multi Million Dollar Empire And I Don't Know What To Do And That's Just The Reality Of It So The Question Is What Can We Do As Managers Who Are Guiding Artists To Hone In On Something Unique About Them And Utilize Our Resources For Other Things That Are Acquiring Funds Such As Placements Such As Licensing Deals Such As Merchandise And Running Also The Promos Online And Tying Them To The Holiday Sales And You Know Keeping An Active Campaign So That The Artists Is Always On The Face Of Social Media But Not Necessarily Because Their Music The Music Is Not What's Making The Money Right Now. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: Yes Vin Placements I Remember Where You Could Get Ten Thousand Dollars Pretty Easily For A New Artist On A Placement Witches. And Now </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: Yeah We We Just Did A Placement For A Film For One Of My Artists And It Was It It Was In The Thousands But It's Not Where It Used To Be So I I Believe That And Unfortunately Relate To It </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Yeah I Was I Was Gonna Say I Think It's Our Job As A Manager To To Sort Of Look At The Layer The Lyn I Rescued Complain About The Fact That Streaming Is In The Numbers And You Know The Bull Bull Crap That's Gone On Within The Industry. But I Can't Necessarily Do Anything About That So My Job Is To Sort Of Knew How Do We Maneuver Through This New Situation And Go Okay Well We're Not Making Money For You Know Again That's The Part Of The Reason Why I Said Why Don't Want To Be A Commission Will Manager Because There's Nothing The Commission Off Of So An Okay Well How Can I Make Money Still Give A Service To An Artist And I Started Looking At Like Well Okay Streaming Is One Thing But There's All These New Things That Were Doing For Artists Now Where You're You Know Maybe It's You're Doing Deals With Wineries Or Your Doing Some Sort Of Deal With With A Brand And There's A Lot Of Co Branding Can Branding In Sort Of The Big Word Now That You Know Everybody Wants To Use To Get Hooked Up With Some Other Brand Had Love To Be On Uh The Coca Cola Tour Or The Taco Bell Tour And Hooking Up With Various And There's All Those Kinds Of Things That Now We're Looking At They Might Be Much Smaller But It's Sort Of Like In The Publishing Industry The Publishing Industry Has Always Been A Nickel Business It's Been Pennies In Nickels And You Just Try To Find Ways To Build It Up So Have You Talked To A Publisher They Going To Go Well I'm Trying To License My Stuff More And Maybe It's With Film And T._v. And Maybe It's With Video Games And Maybe It's With You Too Been People Doing Weddings I Think Barry You've You've Got Something Going On That That Does Some Of That You Know And I Think That's That's What We Have To Do You're Right We Have To Change With The Changes </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 7: But I Liked That Television Is Going To More Of An Indie Market That Much More Never Legs Who To Lose That </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: Sort Of Thing They'll Be Like Young Supervisors And I Think New Bands Can Place Easier. Idea </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: And I Think Eventually If You If You're An Artist Who Has A D._v._d. Or Something Like That Suddenly You Know You Don't Have To Go Through Is Many Doors To Get To To Maybe Get That Thing On Net Flicks We'll Get That Thing On Amazon </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 8: I'd Really Those Huge Or Yeah Yup Yup Cable Subscriptions And Stuff And For Me Personally </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: As Like I Still Have Satellite Television That I'm More Inclined To Watch Something On Net Flicks Because It Makes It You Know The Small Time That I Get To Watch Television As Like Is Not Usually On Mainstream Television For Me And I'd Have To Tape It And It's Like A House Oh At Least When That Flicks I Can Just Turn When I </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Want If We If We Can Just Get People To Binge Listen. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 7: Uh To An Album That Would Be Good Yeah I've Um. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: This Idea That There's There's And I'm Curious If You Guys Have Heard About This That I Hear This Term Alot Called Artistic Middle Class Which Refers To A Lot Of Artists That Don't Necessarily Have Record Deals Anymore. But They Are Touring They Are Making A Living They Don't Have Records On The Radio But Is This Is Something That You Feel Is Is Happening More And More Because I'm Seeing It From The Very You Know Hum. Brand New Artists Who Nobody's Ever Heard Of I Mean I've Met Like Three Or Four Of Them They're Not Nationally Known They They Have Records They Make Three Four Hundred Grand A Year Divided By Four Or Five People It's Not A Fortune But It's Enough For The Ban To Make A Living For Each Person To Live And Just Do Music Is This Something You Guys Are Seeing More And More Of In Your World Or Not </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: I Think Is Just A New Term For A Long Tail Theory I Mean Okay Bands Skin Have </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 10: Bans Are Artists Jimmy Buffett Well No No No I'm Not On The On The Famous Uh What Was That He Is </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Famous But He Was Never Are Grateful Dead For That Matter Yeah They'd Never Sold A Lot Of Records Never You You Worked At Nurse Or You Know That But They Had That Touring Said </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: And I Think At Work And Make Lawyer Indie Bans And Rock Bands I Don't Think It Really Works For Pop Bands.

Or Have An Infrastructure Around Them But They're Doing Half A Million Two Million A Year Just In Tori There Is A There Are Enough Loyal Fan Base That Follows That Community But They Are Not At All Expressed On The Mainstream Platform And I Think That There Regarding That Middle Class Artistic Avenue It It's It Is Something That A Lot Of These Bans Are Doing To Avoid Mainstream Because They Work And Spend Thousands And Thousands Of Dollars Just To Get To The Top Have A Label Take Seventy Percent Of Their Income If They're Fortunate And A Lot Of The Inner Booking Them And A Lot Of Them Are Booking Themselves And Instead They Have An Avenue Were Their Retaining Eighty Percent Mine Is A Booking Agent Know Fortieth If The Outta Manager Will Say Forty Percent Off The Top So They're Still Retaining Sixty Percent But They're Killing It Would Merchandise On Top Of It Which Is A Hundred Fold The Income You're Making Off The Streaming Downloads Do I Think The Middle Class Avenue Is Almost The Direction A Lot Of These Bans Are Taking 'cause They Don't Want To Be Sign Okay </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: So Is It Your Recommendation I Mean Especially For A Lot Of Brand New Artists And We Have A Lot Of Artists Here From Many Different Styles In This Room That They Should Be Developing Merchandise Sales If They're Performing Right Away. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Yeah I Did I Actually Think Hundred Percent I Think Is More Important That You Developing A Fan Base Not Just Developing Tee Shirts Right Yes So It's Really Important To Stick To You Know Again It's Like That Same Argument We Have About. The Digital World And Face Booking Hey I've Got Fifty Thousand Fans On This Or You Know If That's Not Translating. Yeah Yeah So I I Think But I Do Think That You Know The More You Can Get Rid Of Gatekeepers And Goes Iraq The Better </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: And You Should Have Your Own Website I Mean I You Know I Think The Ban Camps And All That Stuff Are Great But You Want To Go Right To The Stores And Buy From Them And Keep In Touch With Them That's Been A Beep Them Wrong I Mean There's Nobody Taking Half Of It </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: And The Audience You Don't Want To Ever Build Your Platform And Your Success On Someone Else's Plot From What Has Been A A Wedding Look At My Space Are Designed Living On Luggage A Lingers In The Rye Went Away Redefined Them So Yeah You Want To Build It On Your Own Website Speaking Of Which In In You Guys Is Mind Is Managers We Spoke About This Yesterday With Two Pros I'm Curious What Your Views Are In Terms Of Managing Artist How Important Is The Social Media Aspect To The Management Of Your Clients Or Of Their Own Careers In Your In Your </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Experience I Think It's Huge Okay Because I I Look At The Analytics Of Everything So That I Can You Know It's Not Just The Numbers But What's The Engagement. So There's I Think That's One Of The Great Things About Social Networking Is You Can Actually Get Information Back If You Do An Ad On On Google Or Wherever You Can Actually Get The Numbers Back You Know Get That From Doing An Ad In Some Magazine </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 7: You Know I Don't Know I Think Face But Members Are Bullshit And People Buy Hits On You Know Five Or Or What Was Her You Know We'll Get Me Like Age Moment Though The Going To Tell You What's </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: Really Happening While In That's This Is Something That I've Been Very Involved In As A Manager Is The Social Media Activity In My Artists And One Of My Artist Was Tops Six On The Ex Factor Season Once Or Her Social Media The Norm Us But Having A Million Followers Collectively On Social Media And Twenty Plus Million Views On You Tube May Translate To One Hundred Ticket Sales And New York And Five Ticket Sales In L._a. Or One Sale In Miami And Two Hundred North Dakota It's Very Hard To Gauge Where That Fan Base Is Located So Social Media Really For Me Is The Pitch To Get 'em In The Door It's For Me To Reach Out To An Agent And Say Look They've Got A Following Their Recognize They're Established Here's All The Media They Been Featured On In The Past Year They're Relevance Now Regarding How Many Tickets They Can Sell I Can't Guarantee That Right Now But What I Can Guarantee Is That If I Put You If You Put Your Artist On This Line Up With An Artist That Drawing Two Or Three Hundred I Can Get Her On Six T._v. Stations Right There And Do Some Extra Promotion For You So You Can Use The Social Media The Benefits Tours Not Necessarily The Utilizing Ticket Sales But By Utilizing Placements For Media Promotion Antiques Me It Seems Like </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: It's Changed A Lot Because Card As Well It Is Really I </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Mean Sosa C._d.

Face Book I Don't Know If You Guys Know This But Only Five Percent Of The People That Fall The You Actually See Each One Of Your Posts Unless You Promote It And There's Heavy Money That Goes Behind This Promotion And One Of The Things That You Need Needed A Manager Is Someone Who Understands The Dynamics Of Social Meter Which We Do Fortunately But Just Because You've Got A Hundred Thousand Followers And I Look At This When I'm Working With Artist Cool You Got A Hundred Thousand Followers How Much Have You Spent In The Last Six Months Promoting To Those Because As Far As I'm Concerned You Got A Hundred Thousand Followers Only Five Thousand Above Seen Any Of Your Both And Those Five Thousand Maybe In The Is It A Plot A Spot You're Never Going To Tour So It's Very Important To Understand The Dynamics Of The Social Media And Have A Campaign To Push Yourself Like A Label Would Which I've Ended Up Doing Dick Easily Ended Up Doing The Tat Yes It </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 4: Is Very Important So That It Shows Up On Other Things I Give You Just Run A Picture On And You're Not Lake Hash Tagging Everything And Tagging Everything On The Picture No One's Going To See It But You And Your.

World Which Is Eighty Percent International Yummy The U. S. Has Got A Huge E. D. M. World No Question About That But A Lot Of The Music I Do Uh Grows In The European Industry Its Way Back To The U. S. Market So Regarding Features I Mean My Artist We Just Uh Just Completed Too Tracks With Israeli D Jays That Blaster Jackson We're Going To Be Working With In Israel You Know So It's In That Commit Expand From There To Europe So From An E. A._t._m. M. Respect You Can Blow Up Internationally Without Ever Having To Leave The Country Regarding Touring It's Brutally Expensive As An Artist Unless You're Unless You're Backed Unless You Got Mom And Dad And If You Do God Bless You. Keep That Don't Pissed Them Off Use It As Much As You Can Cause You're Going To Need It Yes They Is As Long As You Are Putting Yourself On A Platform With An Artist I Was Going To Cater To Your Sounds And It's Going To Give You An Opportunity Did Expose Yourself A Lotta These Stores You Throw Your Cell Phone You Gotta You Know A Fifteen Minute Window You Perform Your Offs Stays The Chance Are You Getting A Meeting Greatest Slim To Denying You Don't Really Get To Bring Much Merchandise Because That's Six Hundred Dollars In Luggage Access So The Opportunities There But What I Recommend It Off The Bat For Someone Who's Growing Now I Would I Would Do It Vicky Talked About Starting Your Community Build A Fan Base Built Family That Love You Build A Core Of Thirty Or Forty People That Say Absolutely Be At Every Show Than You Can Go To Three Than Using Sale Self Forty Tickets And Each One Of These Venues For Sure Than It Grows From There Then You Expand Once You Expanded He Got A Name Then I Think International As A Viable Option For You </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: Know The Other Thing You Can Do In Your Building The Market Is Good With Other Artists No Your Order Something In Your Community And Go Hey Let's Let's Take Three Or Four Of Us Go To A Promoter Or A Club And Say That We Want A Night Because That Way They Don't Have To Sit There And Figure Out Who Who Else Do I Need To Get On This Bill And If You Can Go We've Got Three People You're Sharing Off Of Each Other's Fan Bases You're You're Using Each Other.

That They Have Something New Indifferent And I And I'm Really A Fan Of Bands That Have Something To Say Or Have A Cause That There Is You Know We Can Identity Walk Into Like A Er A Label Or Marketing Company The First Thing They Say Is What's The Story So You Better Figure Out What The Story For You Even Walk In There. Okay </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: My Approaches A Little Different Again Because I Consult So It's Not A Requirement That They Had To Be Uh You Know So If They Don't Have Great Songs But I Can Put Them Them Together With The Producer In In A Writer That Has Great Songs So I'll I'll Tell You My Very First Thing Is Don't Be An Asshole Because I I'm At The Point In My Life Where I Just Don't Want To Deal With Crab I Want That I'll Stay Home With My Kids So It's Really Important For Me That That People Also Have A Very Good Grasp On Expectations Because A Lot Of Times We're We're Doing Is Were Managing A Expectations Of An Artist Or Something Like That But I Do Look For You Know How Talented They Are I Look At You Know Where Their Resources What Are They Have To Work With Um. You Know For Me It's I'm Not Going To Just Take Anybody If They Suck Because You Know When I Go Out I Have To Represent That Artists They're Representing Me And I Still Have To Be Able To Sell That To Someone Who Won Dealing With And If They Suck That Guy's Not Going To Take My Call Anymore So I've I've Gotta Make Sure That If I'm You Know Working An Artist That They've They've Got A Basis Of Some Pretty Good Talent But I Don't Mind How Rod Is </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 7: Okay Dylan I'm Going To Dig Deep Here. One Of The Reasons I Became A Manager Is Because I Hate The Music Industry I </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: Hate The Way Artists Are Treated I Hate How Snooty And Snobby An With The Exception Of The People That Are Part Of This Organization They Are One Of. Uh Doesn't You Know That Actually Have Been Worth My Time In This Industry And I Work With All Sorts Of Execs And Know All Sorts Of Execs And That's Just A Pain In The Ass They Really Are And One Of The Reasons That I Decided To Manage Was Because </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 7: I've Seen Too Many Acts That I Believe In Personally That Have Got Incredible Gifts And Incredible Talents But Just Don't Know How To Capitalize On It Right A </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: Lot Of Managers Won't Even Talk To An Artist Unless They're Making Three Hundred Thousand Dollars A Year Which You Know Translates To Sixty Thousand Dollar Commission In They For A Manager Which Most Top Blunt Managers Do Unless You Have An Income Respect In As Hard As We Work I'm Just Gonna Say We're Entitled To That But It Doesn't Mean We Make Our Decisions Based Upon It So One Of The Things That I Did To Distinguish Myself As A Manager Is All Of The Different Assets You'd Have To Pay For Is An Artist Graphics Videos Design Social Media Promotion Web Sites I Spent Years Studying Noodle So I Do At All Personally For My Artists I Do A Lot Of That Is You Understand So What I Look For In An Artist Is Not Necessarily Some One Who Is Ready Tomorrow To Make Three Hundred Thousand Dollars A Year But Some One Who If I Put All The Time That I'm Willing To Put In Willison We'll Let Me Coach Will Let Me Lead Will Let Me Resource All The Relationships I've Built And We'll Sit Down With Me And Say I Don't Know What To Do Here Can You Help Me And Me Say To Them Who Have You Worked With Over The Past Few Years That I May Not Know Yet Let Me Rebuild Those Relationships For You I've Had Several Artists That Came To Me From Reality T. V. And They Worked With The Biggest Producers The Biggest Agents And Due To Poor Management Off The Show All Of Those Relationships Were Tarnished So I Said Let Me Rebuild Those For You And Now We're Back In The Studio Into Doing Movies In Huge Project With Them So A Manager Is Not Someone Who You Just Pick Up The Phone And Say Hey I Need A Show That's Not What A Manager Does A Manager Literally Becomes Your Partner Mhm And They Become A Percentage Of Your Project And Unless You Find A Manager Who Is Willing To Say Right Now That I'm Not Going To Make Money Off Of You For The Next Year But I'm Willing To Put In Sixty Thousand Dollars A Work Because I Believe You Will Then You Found Yourself A Manager And Those Are Hard To Find Today </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: You Guys Both Mentioned The The Aspect Of The Uh Work Ethic And I Heard Uh Who Who's There Visit There Is A Great Quote From Mandy </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 10: That's What I Was Just Going To Say I Which You Said Vicky Uh </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: While I Was I Was Sitting There Having A Conversation With Them And He Goes You Know Don't Work Harder Than </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 10: Never When At In Your Art As Young As If That's The Case Of That's The Reality It's Not Going To Work On The Same Thing You Want It More Than They Do It Over </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 1: If You're Dealing With The I I Do A Lot Of Work With Kids Who The Parents Are Financing Things And Sometimes At The Look At The Parents Go I Think You Want This More Than Your Kid Does. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 10: Very Dangerous Because You Push It Do You Do You Look For That Kind Of Work Ethic Do You Look For That Kind Of Personality Or Different Personality Traits In In The People Get Their I Mean I've Known I've Known A In Our People Who Are Passed On Who Went On To Be Very Successful Artists Because Of That Because They Said I Could Never Work With This Person Because This Person Either Has A Bad Work Ethic Is Not Driven Or Whatever They Didn't Go On To Have Success But They They Knew They Knew And I've From Your Point </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 5: Is A Band In L._a.

Get You Some Radio When We've Done All Of That And Now All Of A Sudden They Both Levels Are Knocking Out The Door So Make Sure That That Artist From My Perspective Worked As Hard As You Do In That That's Absolutely And I I'm Glad You Said That Or Harder Or Heart Preferably Harder But I Am I Met The Position Now And I Think Is The Young Manager When You First Answer You're Willing To Take Anything You Can Get But After Being Burned Enough Time Than Working With An Enough Artists You Realize Very Quickly The The Artist Your Science In How Valuable Your Time Is How How </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: Is N._y.
