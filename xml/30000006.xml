Yeah Working Tell Us About What You Do Um Well. Funny I Own A Company That Uh Ranges Funding For Startup Businesses Now Does Start At Businesses Into Recently Had Nothing To Do With Film Uh By I Ran Into Some People That Own A Production Company And They Explained To Me That Independent Film If Nothing But A Start-up Company And They Just Jumped Straightforward Too I Just Funded Thirty Two Film Makers Or Film Production We Intend To Do Over A Thousand In The Next Year I Own Film Funding L._a. But It's Really Just Started Up Funding And Small Business Funding So There's No Difference Between A Gourmet Food Truck Ah An Independent Film Or A Our Dislike Yourselves If You Need Money For Development If You Need Money To Hire Attorneys To Travel To Record To To Hire All Of The Wonderful Panelists That That You've Had Here Today Ah That We're Here For And Normally Or Startup Program Starts At Fifty Thousand Thousand So Fifty To Two Hundred Thousand Per Person And Normally Just You Know One Person In A Family With Good Personal Class And It So Ah I'm Going To Be Here For The Next Two Hours I'd Love To Talk To Anybody Do You Have Cards. And I'm Happy To Take Questions Julius Or Or Anyone Yea I It It's Fast Saying Because What You're Doing Is Enabling People To Find Money And It's Not Equity You Mentioned To Me It's Debt That's Right And Not In The Negative Sense Of Debt No Effort It's Lines Of Credit Like If You At A Credit Card No One Would Tell You What To Do With It If You Needed To Pay An Attorney You Needed To Pay Let's Say A Recording Time I'm Think Of Things Would Apply To I've Only Been In In Music For About An Hour So But Whatever You Guys Need You Know It's Probably The Same Things It's It's The If You're Buying A Song From Somebody There's A Cost If You're If It's Recording Time Pressing Or P. R. All The Same Things Happening Film They're Just The Hardest Thing In Film And I've Now But In Film For Almost A Year And I I Mean I'm Doing Six Educational Events This This Coming. So We're Really Deeply Into Film And We Can Do The Same Thing For Music. But. We Love It And Everyone Seems To Have The Same It's The Start Up Costs It's The Beginning Cause And I Think Everyone Here Is Really At That Beginning Stage Where They Need Like The Previous Panel They Need Social Media And There's A Cost Do It They Need Your Help They Need Help From A Lot Of Different Experts And To Promote Themselves And No One's Going To End You That Kind Of Money It Just. To Start A Piece That's The Hardest Part So In A Sense You Act As As A Uh A Broker Between These People And The Money That And You In In Some Sense You Don't Really I Don't Hate Toward The Use Were Care But It Doesn't Really Matter What It Is It's Not For Us To Decide That You Were A Great Act And Promised Saying We Are Simply Here For Funding Yeah Julia Mathematical Function We're Going To Educate You As Far As What Your Options Are We're Going To Listen To What You're Looking For We're Going Give You Any Guidance We Can And We're Going To Go Get Your Funded We Only Get Paid Upon Success So You Don't Get Funded We Don't Make Anything So Obviously We're Going To Get It Done Do You Have Any Case Studies That You Could Tell Us About Something That Happened It Was Of Interest To These Folks I Mean I Have Hundreds But They're Not Music Most Of I Mean Literal Or Film. Even The Film Because We're At That Startup Stage Either A Start Up Production Company Or A Start Up Production It's So Early On That Often There's No Name Yet Like They're They're Going To Buy A Script They Don't Even Have The Scrubbed Where They Have A Scripted The Working Title But Part Of That Initial Normally In Film Development Is Let They Sixty Seventy Thousand In Dollars At Least The First One Eighty Three That I've Done That We're Going Through Development It Was The Highest Whether It Was Ninety Seven And The Lowest Was Sixteen Hum. And Each Case Was Different I Mean I Can Think Of One In Particular Where Seventy Five Hundred Of That First Seventy Five Thousand And That Aid None Of Us But They Paid For Money That We Helped Them Raise Was To Rewrite The Script 'cause The Guy Wrote A Two Hundred And Fifty Page Gripped Does He Didn't Know Any Better That Should Have Been Ninety Uh You Know He's A A C._p._a. Who Just Quit His Job And Decided To Of Read This Well But Someone Else Is A Script Writer And They Don't Need That What You Need Is In Particular To Your Situation But Money Is Pretty Universe Yes Unfortunately Yeah We All Need Money We All Need It And I'm Happy To Help Anyone With It Yet So So Is There Way For Us To Take Any Questions From The Audience For These Panelists F. U. Wine Hum I Can Just. Two Two Two Can Now Are There We Go Ah. I Am Interested Than I Am More Uh About This Because Money Doesn't Come Free So So What Is The Process Of Paying That Money Back What The Interest Rate Was The Time Frame I'm Sure That It's Different Different People Second Stances But Can You Give Us A Bowl Pock Short It's Not Just Different Circumstances It It We Have Different Programs It's Not Just One Program But The Standard Program Eight If You Have A Credit Card Essentially Were Going To Bring You A Larger One How's That So We're Not Bringing You Money Meaning You Haven't Taken A Loan You've Taken The Opportunity To Use A Certain Amount Of Money So What Brought You A Fifty Thousand Dollar Credit Card You're Not Yet Spending At Your At You'd Have Sure So Do We Need To Pay That Back Every Month Is There A Longer Period Of Time Right What Is The Difference In Terms Of An Interest Rate Glad To A Credit Card Why The Better To Go Through You Apart From Obviously The Lodge Align Across Well It's The Larger Line Of Credit That Really Is The The Reason I Know In Other Words If You Have A Five Thousand Dollar Credit Card And You Went To Another Bank You Might Get Another One We're Normally Going To Get You At Least Ten Times The Size Of Your Largest Credit Card Literally Ten That's The Standard Number So If You Have A Five Thousand Dollar Credit Cards And Decent. Maybe With A Little Manipulation A Little Repair Whatever We're Going To Go Get Your Fifty But Then Again If You Had A Ten Thousand Dollar Home Depot Card We're Going To Go Get Your And We Can Do That For Every One So You Might Have Three Family Members That Also Would Like To Go Funded Maybe To Help You May Be To Do Something Else You Might Have Other People In Your Production Company In Your Band In Your Whatever We Can Do That For Each Person And It Really Starts Adding Up And Then We Can Grow You Year After Year So Your Question Was What's The Months We Pay Me Yes I'm Didn't Mean To Avoid Lenora Yell Guy I Was Going To Blow Up Okay Um The Monthly Payments I'm Going To Just Talk About Like The Most The The Bottom Program That The Beginning Program Which Is Usually Fifty To Two Hundred Thousand Per Person Some In That Program Obviously There's No Payments On Something You Don't Oh So You Can't Pay Anything Unto You Use Some Of That Money The Payment Is Normally Two Per Cent Of The Outstanding Balance That Month So If I Brought You A Fifty Thousand Dollar Credit Card And He Didn't Use It For A Month You're Payment We're Busy Around. If I Brought You A Fifty Thousand Dollar Credit Card And You Used Five Thousand Dollars In Order To Keep That For A Year You're Not Using It Temporarily Than You Are Going To Oh A Hundred Dollars A Month But Most Of What We Do At That Level Is No Interest For Twelve To Twenty Four Months You You're Gonna Oh Two Percent Or A Hundred Dollars A Month But Every Time You Make That Payment You Don't Know Five Thousand Now Yo Forty Nine And The Next Month When You Make Your Hundred Dollar Payment Yo Forty Eight Hundred What You're Doing Showing The Bank You're Willing To Make It On Time Payment But They're Not Taking Anything Out Of It There's No Interest So There's But There's Still A Payment And You Want There To Be A Payment That's A Great Thing Because You Want To Prove You Could Make Payments On Time So Next Year We Could Go Get You More Money And More And More And More Yet Because We're In The Growth Business We Want You And Everyone You Can Bring Us And We Want To Continue To Work With You If You're Willing There's No Commitment But We Want To Grow You Further And Further And Just The The Follow Up With The Other Part Of The Question After That Twelve To Twenty Four Months What Sort Of Interest Uh Are We Looking At We Uh I Know You'll Think It's Funny We We Don't Pay Much Attention To That Because Again Our Job If The Printed Rate Was Fifteen Or Nineteen Percent We Paint Almost No Attention That And That's Because Once The Interest Starts If You Of Followed Are Guidelines Basically Paid On Time That We Go Back And Renegotiate The Limit Higher And The Interest Lower So When Interest Starts That's Just The Time That We Go Renegotiate For You Okay Okay But The Printed Rates Or Whatever The Printed Rates Are So If If It's Fifteen Or Nineteen And That's That Is That The Ballpark If They Nineteen It's Kind Of General I Saw One That Was Nineteen Point Seven Recently And And I've Seen Others That Were Like Twelve Point Too. It's Not Up To Us What We're Doing Is We're Feeding You Into Programs That Already Exist At The Bank Okay So We're Not Negotiating With A Bang On Anything Other Than Getting You The Approval After That We're Teaching You How To Put Yourself In A Position So Next Year Fifty Becomes A Hundred A Hundred Becomes Too Two Becomes For To Either You Could Keep Growing Or You Can Leave Adding People And You All Keep Growing Thank You Very Much They They're Very I Think You'd Ever Run As Well For All The Information No Worries Thank You And Any Other Questions From The Audience Uh Guys Come Up To The Mike Or Just The I Mean He Pretty Much Covered All My Questions That I Was An To Like What Interested Use Humor As In The Music Uh Aspect Of Oz Very Similar To Film And I Met I Met Buried By Uh I Just Got To Nineteen Thousand Uh Filmmakers On My Link Den And Somehow Berry Had Film Connected To His Profile And We Started Talking And This Was Uh I Think Five Days Ago So I've This Is The It Out It Was It Real Saint In This For About A By Tomorrow I Could Imagine I'll Own. Film You Know Instead Of Film Funding L._a. It'll Be Music Funding L._a. But It Just Is To Make You Comfortable With That And We Are In Music Other Than That It's The Same Startup Techniques You're Just A Company To Us Even If You Haven't Opened A Corporation Yet You're A Company And You Were The Person I'm Talking To Your The Person I'm Trying To Grow If You Bring Me A Group Of People Will Work With Them All Together But Really Each One Gets Very Individual Consulting And Counseling And And It Would It Be Better If He Had An R._m._c. Or Does It Does That It's All Part Of The Consulting As Definitely Not Something You Need Before Which Working With Us At All And We'll Guide You If If That's We'll We'll Talk To You About Why You Would Do It What The Benefits Are It's Obviously Part Of The Long Term Plan For Our Guidance Because We Normally Move People From Personal Credit To Business Credit To Corporate Credit To Buying A Business For One To Five Million Through The S._p._c._a. So Those Are The Basic For Companies For Products Two Of Those Four Require You To Have A Corporation So It's Part Of A Strategy But It May Or May Not Be Appropriate For You Will Talk About It. And Then The Um Consultation They Are Is Your Business Located Here In San Diego Or The Los Angeles Or Can You Do It's Their Phone Argued Escape Hard Look On His Mom Lay Off At Us It's Mimi I'm I Have Got Cards And Not Hand Them Out As Soon As I While Cage Shore. Any Other Questions For Any Of Our Three Panelists Here They're All A Mate Yeah I Do Have A Question So Uh Let's Say Basic Credit You Get A Certain Amount I Dunno Plugging You Guys May Be On The Hip Hop Scene But As An Artist Who If Who Can Get A Good Amount Of People To Show Up To A Venue What Do You Think Would Be A Good Idea To Start Investing That Money It Would It Be In Trying To Get A Feature With Larger Artists And Then Pay Back Or Would It Be Trying To Get Onto A Tour Which Normally You Know You Pay A Certain Amount Maybe Ticket Sales For A Certain Slot Like What Read In General For Or Maybe Even Just A Band What Do You Think Would Be The Smartest Way For An Artist Using That Money Initially To Maybe Make Some Back 'cause I Don't Know If You Sell You All The Ticket Sales And Everything After That You Can Put In Your Pocket Said If They Sell A Hundred Tickets After That The Rest You Start You Can Keep Uh Yeah I I A I Think This Is More Of A Question For For Barry And I And I Would Say You Know The The Big Question You Know What You Do With Your Money Even If You're Your Dad Gives You Twenty Granting Says Go Become Famous What Do You Do You Know And That's Always The Biggest Question You Know The Money Is Now In Touring There's No Doubt About It Paid Gigs Where They're Being Paid A Few Hundred To Many Thousands Of Dollars Per Show Them One Bag And Film T._v. Placement Is Still An Area Where We Can Send You A Nice Shack Between A Few Hundred Bucks Up Two Hundred Hundred And Fifty Even For An The Artists For Commercial So You Know What He's Doing Is Giving You The Money Did Then Decide Do I Go In The Studio And Make The Best Recording You Know Do I Go And I I You Know Get Everything I Can Do Together For My Roadshow Higher Side Player Higher The Better You Know Make Sure That I Haven't Got Hop Tore Manager And Maybe I Have To You Know Get Him Some Money To Start So So What He'll Do Is Help You Get The Money And Then We Can Assist You'd How To Spend It Believe Me We Can Assist You And How Does That I Believe We're Good It's Spending Money I Would Also Like To Add That If You Are Trying To Build A Career For Yourself As An Artist And You Were Given A Set Amount Of Money What I Would Do Is I Would Try To Expand That Career Like That's What A Lotta People Are Doing In Here And I Would Do It Through Trying To Expand Your Audience Recordings Everyone In This Room Who Knows How To Use A Computer Knows That You Don't Need To Spend What It Costs For A House To Make A Record You Use To I Mean That Was The Way It Was Ten Fifteen Years Ago It Was A Six Figure Investment In The Only People That That Kinda Money We're Labels It's Not True Anymore What Is The Costs Now Is Marketing That Or In The Case Of Of You As An Artist It's Getting Yourself Out There I Would Use That Money Too. Tour Because Touring As Expensive If You Go Up To San Francisco Where You're Not Known It Cost You Money It Costs You Money For Gas It Costs You Money To Stay At A Place It Cost You Money To Do Whatever Used Wisely But That's What Is Crucial For You If You Were Going To Take Money If Somebody's Going To Give You Fifty Or Seventy Five Grand I Would Say That The Most Important Thing For You Is To Build An Audience I Would Say That To Anyone In This Room That Hey Most Important Remember We're No Longer In The Era In The Music Business Of Selling Anything We Would There's Nothing To Sell I Mean This Point Was Made Brilliantly Last Year With Drake One But Three Billion You Downloads And Not A Single Sale And Well I'm I'm Exaggerating But Relative To Three Billion Down But But Uh Streams I Mean As I Get A Minuscule One Twenty Albums Sold Or Something So We're No Longer Selling Anything What You're Selling As Yourself You're Selling You Use The Artist And The Only Thing That Hasn't Value In Exactly Is The Hard Ticket Of Showing Up To See You On That Stage And That Has Real Value That's Where I Would Be Putting The Money Into Taking What It Would Take To Go To Wherever It Where Is Your Bases In San Diego Is In L._a. Or At Least Live Out Here I'm Actually On L._a. Right Now In The Valley Okay Yeah That's What I'm I'm In Sherman Oaks So On As A Am I Would Say Than You Wanna Start Expanding Too You Know Some Of The Other Territories Outside Of L._a. Weather In San Diego Or San Jose Jose Live Or Wherever Yeah Start Building That That's Where I Would Be Using The Money For You As A Career You Can Make Recordings Very Inexpensively Okay And I Would Also Say That One Of The Most Important Things For Someone Like Yourself Who's Trying To Build A Career Who's Going To Do It Through Life Performances In This Goes For Everybody Have Something To Sell At Your Performance Have Merchandise Have C._d.s That You Can Sign At A Booth Afterwards Have Tee Shirts Have Something That People Can Take And You Know Purchased From You That That That Number One It's Smart From A Branding Point Of View Number Two It It's Very Smart From An Economic Point Of View If You're Building A Base And It's Proven The Number One Thing Though What Is It Ninety Percent Any Merchandise Winter Land All Of Them Will Tell You Ninety Percent Include It With Each You Or The Rolling Stones Ninety Percent Of The Merchandise Is Sold At The Concert There Is A Very Very Little Even The Rolling Stones I Mean Maybe Ten Percent Of Their Merchandise Is Sold On Line After The Facts Were Whale After The Event So That's What So So Many Artists Don't Want To Invest Money Into Having Stuff To Sell To Their Audience And I Think That That's A Real Waste Especially If You're Going To Be Touring Use It Huh If You Do Your Math Right You Could Profit Exactly But But Most Important You Can Build Something And And You Can Get Their Email Address You Can You Know You There's Ways Of Utilizing It To Build Your Your Your It's Not Social Media And It's Not Only About Money It's About We're Talking About Building A Career Here And You Asked About How You Would Use That Money To Build The Career That Would Be The Way I Would Say I Would Say That Any Act That The Most Important Thing Is Not Recordings Unless You're You You Have Desires Of Being The Next You Know Beyond Say Or Pop Kind Of Back A Major Label Is The Thing For You Because No One Can Do That As Well As They Can And That's A Very Very Very Expensive Game And The Truth Is They're Offering It To Fewer And Fewer And Fewer And Fewer People That's That's The Reality Of Any Meal You Look At These I Mean I Document This Stuff And It's Like Sony Columbia Records Had A Hundred And Thirty Seven Artists On The Roster Five Years Ago The Only They Have Now Have Less Than Half Mustn't Have Have Sixty Eight Wow That That's One Of The Largest Labels In The Business So It It's It's Gone Way Way Way Way Way Down That's The Thing There's Not As Much Money In The Industry I Mean That's Sort Of The Given What's Not Set In That Statement Is That The Labels And All Their Staff Sir Commensurate With Not Having The Same Amount Of Money The Same Thing With Them A Movie Business Disney Warner's Ten Years Ago They Used To Put Out Eighteen Movies A Year Disney Cook That The Chairman A Disney Said We're Lucky If We Put Out Nine Or Ten Because We're Putting In Twenty Times The Amount Of Money With One Or Two Hundred Million Over Film But We're Not Putting Eighteen Of 'em Out A Year So It's The Same Thing It's Like You Know When You Talk About Artists Where I Was Saying Before In Las One At The Most Important Thing Today Is To Get People's Attention It's The Hardest Thing To Do And I Think One Of The Best Ways To Do It Is For An Artist Is Through Their Music Too Alive Performance And That's Where I Would Use I Agree And Can Do That Oh One Less Thing Of Our You Actually What He's Saying Is Actually True You're Building Your Bright Like I'm Going To Take A League Should Example But It's True A Brittany Spears Per From New Stores Still Perform In Vegas Wide She Lifts Things That Nobody Goes There To Watch A Perform Life Why She Looks Good She Has The Phenomenon You Know Everybody Wants To Watch Yeah Same With Mariah Carey Why Is That Is The Same Thing And I'm Sorry Forgive Bags We Are Living In That Age You Like I Saw His I Actually Heard Has Song Outcast Unlike Men It's Totally Cool Why Your Personality Your Brand Right You Need To Build Your Brand Your Looks That's Really Important And Owning Your Fans I Keep In Franchising And Every Confidence Own It Don't Give It Away To Face Book Insert Again Because Of The Reality Is You're Working For Them They're Making Money Off Of Your Content They're Making Money Out Of Your Ass They're Not Paying You Anything You Too There Is Another Story There So You And It's Kind Of A Shitty Rural And I'm From The Tech World And I Will Not Take The Blame Because Didn't Create It But It's All About Owning Your Fans Building A Brand You Know And That's Going To Change Everything I This Brand I Watch Are Jazz Totally Jazz And They Sold Out Six Thousand Uh Was Actually A City National In San Jose Six Thousand People There Are Sold Out Why They Want To Watch Them There Are Cool He's Performing And He Makes Most Of His Money Selling Tickets So He's Actually Read Right It's Like So Would You Take It It's All About Your Brian And Owning A Fence Convert Them Convert Get Everything As Much As A Cat Yeah Merchandise Of Course The Number One Yeah You Ever Hear Of Joe Anyone In This Room Heard Idol One Of Them Was A Lot Of People Haven't But He's The Classic Example Of This Uh I Went To A Conference In The Summer That Had His Social Media People There He Started Out With Two Thousand Face Books Hours With The Very Beginning Of His Career No Record Just Through Life Performance Bill Doing It But He Bill He's Now Has Fifteen Albums That He's Produced Himself And He Makes Six Million Bucks A Year But A Lot Of People Haven't Heard Of Him My Point Of Bringing Him Up Is That He's The Classic Ultimate Independent Artist Who Build His Career On His Own And Who Has The Psych Incredible Empty Check 'em Out Just Check Out The Uh The Website Joe Dot Com It's An Incredible Lesson To Any Artists In Terms Of Branding What He Does How He Does It What He Offers His Merge And It's All Owned By Him One Hundred Percent All The Great Rappers Have Done That Look At Look At What's His Name His Real Name Master P. But Percy Forget His Last Name He Started Out That Way Uh Jay Z Started Out That Way I Mean Now These People Were All Moguls And They Own Their Content They Own Their Brown You Know They're Not Beholden To Someone Else But That's That's The Thing About It You There's There's A Lot Of Examples You Can Use And Look Toward That Was The Only Point Am I Am Making Toward Flus Drink Lower Than Goes Yeah That's Really Straightforward Thank You Go To Young Link You. It Was It Was Kind Of Are Going Off Of What He Said Be You Are Talking About Like Standing Near Career Through Touring And Em How Major Labels Or What Take It To The Next Level I Think That Our Eyes When This Ad Appreciate Of What You Said About Expanding Through Joying Grading That You Know Ground Four Fan Base Because There's People Like The Weekend Who Started Off That Way And Now He's On A Major Any Like Beyond Any Do The Beyond Say Canada The Not Beyond Anything By Philip Kind Of Like What You Said He's Doing The The Pop Thing But He Was He Was Very Independent You Know And Be All That Stuff For Now And Then He Tore All Year Now I Know His Story Very I'm Very Well And He He Did It The Right Way I Mean And And It Took Three Albums Yes No Evolved War And He Gave Them Away For Free Mhm Teachers Posted The First One On The Internet The Second One Of The But Any It Never Performed But Built That Bays If Steadily Steadily Steadily And The Thing That Helped Him Was Someone As He Built That Base Someone In Camp Said To I Heard The Sky And The Connection Was He's From Toronto And Drake Is From Toronto They're Both Canadians Who Said You Should Check 'em Out And Drink Did Whoever The Trusted I Don't Know Who That Trusted Source But Dragged Did Check Them Out And Treated About Him And That Really Was The Thing That Helped Catapulted Him To That Next Level It Didn't Make Him A Star But It Helped Get The Attention To Where I Think Universal Took Those Three Albums Bundled Them And They Were Already Given Away For Free But At That's Another Great Example Of The Modern Way In Which It's Done Where The Concept And This Is An Important One For Artists The Concept Of Giving Something Away For Free In Hopes Of Getting You To Buy Something Else Prince Understood That Concept Yes I Mean Years Ago He Gave Away His Album For Free If You Bought A Concert Tickets In K. Either That An England To Eat A Twenty One Night The O. Two Arena He Gave Away The Album For For You Got An Album When You Walked In The Door The C._d. Came As Everybody Gave Their Ticket And The Distributors In England Freaked And When He Was And He Did What It Was Called The Cover Melt He Put The C._d. On The Cover Of The Sunday Paper And When They Asked Him Because The Agreement Was He'll Do An Interview With The Paper In Changed For That Three Point Eight Million Copies And They Said Why Are You Doing This He Said Because We're A Couple Of Reasons This Showed Me How Bright He Was He Said For An Artist At The Stage Of Their Life And Career Than I Am At If I Did At The Traditional Way At Best I Would Say In England Forty To Fifty Two Thousand Copies At Best Okay If I Did At The Traditional Way This Way Three Point Eight Million People Were Getting My New C._d. Who Knows This Was A Courtroom Him Maybe They'll Buy A Concert Tickets Maybe They'll Buy Some Merchandise Maybe The Like The Music And Check Out My Previous Catalogue Pay The Come To A Show I Mean Whatever It Was He Felt That It Was Giving Something Away For Free In Hopes Of Getting You To Buy It Something Else It's Such An Important Concept Today That I Think Really Neat You Know This Idea Of By By By What Are We Selling Today Every Every R. S. Everything Has To Really Think That And What It Is The Answer Is Themselves Not The Record Not The Sit Nobody Cares It's All You Know It's All Free Anyway So By The Brand It's Not Necessarily You Know Is Not Necessarily Records And All That Because I'm John Building Does Does The Same Thing You Put Out Three Makes Sense For Free And Now He's Finally Doing Stuff With Billboard But He Had Built That Fan Base By Touring Around John Who John Belly Any This New Eason In You Know Yet Beg Megan Love John. Yep Beautiful Now Yeah In Megan Loves John Billion Twos But I Just Wanted Use That As It Is An Example Because He Put Out Three Free Mix Tape Gain Guarded A Fan Base Toward All Round Then He Signed Is Deal And Actually You Know He Signed The Deal And And Then Said I Want To Put These Upper Free Like He He Made Chose A Stipulation Is Contracts Artists Want That There Was A Good Point That You Made. The Other Important Point About What You're Talking About Is Anybody Who Builds A Fan Base. From Alive Perspective It's My Experience That They Will Always Have A Career Okay They Always Will Have A John Most People Don't Others John Mayor Had A Very Large Fan Base Before He Got His Record Deal He Got A Deal On A Small Independent Label Called Aware Records Out To Chicago Before Columbia Picked Him Up With The Very First Room For Squares Album He Had Done That Album Essentially Eight Songs Of It They Ask Them To Write For Five More For The Debut My Point Is That He Had An Enormous Fan Base The Second Album He Did Was A Double Live Album Who Does A Double I've Album For Their Second Album Unless They Have That Strong Fan Base Point Being Anyone In This Room Think Of An Artist That You've Discovered On Record And Fallen In Love With Any Point In Your Life You Found A C._d. An Artist You Fell In Love With It Went To See The Act Live And They Were Terrible. Okay I See Some Of You Have Had That Experience My Experience Tells Me That Artist Stopped Becoming A Career Artist For You You Are Not Automatically Buying There Next Record You Were Not It Was Going To Take A Miracle To Get You To Go To Their Show Again Okay But You Take The Same Scenario You're Talking About A Building That Whether It's Mixed Tapes Or Whatever And Going To See Them Live Falling In Love With Them Going To See Them Lie For The First Time And There Are Better Than The Record My Experience Tells Me That Artist As The Started Becoming A Career Artist For You You'll Forgive Them A Bad Album You'll Be There When The Next One Comes Out You Will Buy Those Tickets To That Show You Will By That Merchandise You Will Purchase The Vinyl Records Even Though You Don't Own A Turntable Okay Because You're A Fan Of That Artist And When You Have That When You Truly Have That Records Don't Matter That's What I've Learned Don't Believe Me Look At The Many Many Many Myriad Of Acts From The From Sixty Seventies Eighties Nineties Who Don't Make Records Anymore Or Have Hit Who Are Still Performing Every Single Night For Huge You Know From Seven Hundred Seats To Fifty Thousand Seats In All I Mean The Rolling Stones Haven't Had Hits And Thirty Five Years But They're Still Selling Out People At Much Lower Levels Are Still Doing It So That's Why The I Think Today It's So Important It's So Important Because Recordings Don't Mean Anything Money Wise Anymore I Mean Truly They Don't Unless You're Taylor Swift Or Or A Dell Who Are Too Out Liars Of The Paradigm That We Live In Today Truly They Are I Mean They're Blessed In They're Very Fortunate But They're Out Liars Of A It's Like The Joke In The Business Today Is Two Million Is The New Ten That's What Everybody Says Two Million Is Newton Because That's What A Lot Of The Superstars Like Weekend Like Beyond Say Like Jay Z That's What They Sell One Point Eight To Two Million. So Anyway Long Winded Answer To Your Own Bankruptcy While But It Is A Good It's A Good Went Ah So Any Other Questions And Then I Think We're Going To Wrap For Lunch Right.

R. All The Same Things Happening Film They're Just The Hardest Thing In Film And I've Now But In Film For Almost A Year And I I Mean I'm Doing Six Educational Events This This Coming. So We're Really Deeply Into Film And We Can Do The Same Thing For Music. But. We Love It And Everyone Seems To Have The Same It's The Start Up Costs It's The Beginning Cause And I Think Everyone Here Is Really At That Beginning Stage Where They Need Like The Previous Panel They Need Social Media And There's A Cost Do It They Need Your Help They Need Help From A Lot Of Different Experts And To Promote Themselves And No One's Going To End You That Kind Of Money It Just. To Start A Piece That's The Hardest Part </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: So In A Sense You Act As As A Uh A Broker Between These People And The Money That And You In In Some Sense You Don't Really I Don't </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 11: Hate Toward The Use Were Care But It Doesn't Really Matter What It Is It's Not For Us To Decide That You Were A Great Act And Promised Saying We Are Simply Here For Funding Yeah Julia Mathematical Function We're Going To Educate You As Far As What Your Options Are We're Going To Listen To What You're Looking For We're Going Give You Any Guidance We Can And We're Going To Go Get Your Funded We Only Get Paid Upon Success So You Don't Get Funded We Don't Make Anything So Obviously We're Going To Get It Done Do You Have Any Case Studies That You Could Tell Us About Something That Happened It Was Of Interest To These Folks I Mean I Have Hundreds But They're Not Music Most Of I Mean Literal Or Film. Even The Film Because </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 10: We're At That Startup Stage Either A Start Up Production Company Or A Start Up Production It's So Early On That Often There's No Name Yet Like They're They're Going To Buy A Script They Don't Even Have The Scrubbed Where They Have A Scripted The Working Title But Part Of That Initial Normally In Film Development Is Let They Sixty Seventy Thousand In Dollars At Least The First One Eighty Three That I've Done That We're Going Through Development It Was The Highest Whether It Was Ninety Seven And The Lowest Was Sixteen Hum. And Each Case Was Different I Mean I Can Think Of One In Particular Where Seventy Five Hundred Of That First Seventy Five Thousand And That Aid None Of Us But They Paid For Money That We Helped Them Raise Was To Rewrite The Script 'cause The Guy Wrote A Two Hundred And Fifty Page Gripped Does He Didn't Know Any Better That Should Have Been Ninety Uh You Know He's A A C._p._a. Who Just Quit His Job And Decided To Of Read This Well But Someone Else Is A Script Writer And They Don't Need That What You Need Is In Particular To Your Situation But Money Is Pretty Universe Yes </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 11: Unfortunately Yeah We All Need Money We All Need It And I'm Happy To Help Anyone With It Yet So </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: So Is There Way For Us To Take Any Questions From The Audience For These Panelists F. U. Wine Hum I Can Just. Two Two Two Can Now Are There We Go Ah. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 11: I Am Interested Than I Am More Uh About This Because Money Doesn't Come Free So So What Is The Process Of Paying That Money Back What The Interest Rate Was The Time Frame I'm Sure That It's Different Different People Second Stances But Can You Give Us A Bowl Pock Short It's Not Just Different Circumstances It It We Have Different Programs It's Not Just One Program But The Standard Program Eight If You Have A Credit Card Essentially Were Going To Bring You A Larger One How's That So We're Not Bringing You Money Meaning You Haven't Taken A Loan You've Taken The Opportunity To Use A Certain Amount Of Money So What Brought You A Fifty Thousand Dollar Credit Card You're Not Yet Spending At Your At You'd Have Sure So Do We Need To Pay That Back Every Month Is There A Longer Period Of Time Right What Is The Difference In Terms Of An Interest Rate Glad To A Credit Card Why The Better To Go Through You Apart From Obviously The Lodge Align Across Well It's The Larger Line Of Credit That Really Is The The Reason I Know In Other Words If You Have A Five Thousand Dollar Credit Card And You Went To Another Bank You Might Get Another One We're Normally Going To Get You At Least Ten Times The Size Of Your Largest Credit Card Literally Ten That's The Standard Number So If You Have A Five Thousand Dollar Credit Cards And Decent. Maybe With A Little Manipulation A Little Repair Whatever We're Going To Go Get Your Fifty But Then Again If You Had A Ten Thousand Dollar Home Depot Card We're Going To Go Get Your And We Can Do That For Every One So You Might Have Three Family Members That Also Would Like To Go Funded Maybe To Help You May Be To Do Something Else You Might Have Other People In Your Production Company In Your Band In Your Whatever We Can Do That For Each Person And It Really Starts Adding Up And Then We Can Grow You Year After Year So Your Question Was What's The Months We Pay Me Yes I'm Didn't Mean To Avoid Lenora Yell Guy I Was Going To Blow Up Okay Um The Monthly Payments I'm Going To Just Talk About Like The Most The The Bottom Program That The Beginning Program Which Is Usually Fifty To Two Hundred Thousand Per Person Some In That Program Obviously There's No Payments On Something You Don't Oh So You Can't Pay Anything Unto You Use Some Of That Money The Payment Is Normally Two Per Cent Of The Outstanding Balance That Month So If I Brought You A Fifty Thousand Dollar Credit Card And He Didn't Use It For A Month You're Payment We're Busy Around. If I Brought You A Fifty Thousand Dollar Credit Card And You Used Five Thousand Dollars In Order To Keep That For A Year You're Not Using It Temporarily Than You Are Going To Oh A Hundred Dollars A Month But Most Of What We Do At That Level Is No Interest For Twelve To Twenty Four Months You You're Gonna Oh Two Percent Or A Hundred Dollars A Month But Every Time You Make That Payment You Don't Know Five Thousand Now Yo Forty Nine And The Next Month When You Make Your Hundred Dollar Payment Yo Forty Eight Hundred What You're Doing Showing The Bank You're Willing To Make It On Time Payment But They're Not Taking Anything Out Of It There's No Interest So There's But There's Still A Payment And You Want There To Be A Payment That's A Great Thing Because You Want To Prove You Could Make Payments On Time So Next Year We Could Go Get You More Money And More And More And More Yet Because We're In The Growth Business We Want You And Everyone You Can Bring Us And We Want To Continue To Work With You If You're Willing There's No Commitment But We Want To Grow You Further And Further And Just The The Follow Up With The Other Part Of The Question After That Twelve To Twenty Four Months What Sort Of Interest Uh Are We Looking At We Uh I Know You'll Think It's Funny We We Don't Pay Much Attention To That Because Again Our Job If The Printed Rate Was Fifteen Or Nineteen Percent We Paint Almost No Attention That And That's Because Once The Interest Starts If You Of Followed Are Guidelines Basically Paid On Time That We Go Back And Renegotiate The Limit Higher And The Interest Lower So When Interest Starts That's Just The Time That We Go Renegotiate For You Okay Okay But The Printed Rates Or Whatever The Printed Rates Are So If If It's Fifteen Or Nineteen And That's That Is That The Ballpark If They Nineteen It's Kind Of General I Saw One That Was Nineteen Point Seven Recently And And I've Seen Others That Were Like Twelve Point Too. It's Not Up To Us What We're Doing Is We're Feeding You Into Programs That Already Exist At The Bank Okay So We're Not Negotiating With A Bang On Anything Other Than Getting You The Approval After That We're Teaching You How To Put Yourself In A Position So Next Year Fifty Becomes A Hundred A Hundred Becomes Too Two Becomes For To Either You Could Keep Growing Or You Can Leave Adding People And You All Keep Growing Thank You Very Much They They're Very I Think You'd Ever Run As Well For All The Information </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: No Worries Thank You And Any Other Questions From The Audience Uh Guys Come Up To The Mike Or Just </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 12: The I Mean He Pretty Much Covered All My Questions That I Was An To Like What Interested Use Humor As In The Music Uh Aspect Of Oz Very Similar To Film And </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 11: I Met I Met Buried By Uh I Just Got To Nineteen Thousand Uh Filmmakers On My Link Den And Somehow Berry Had Film Connected To His Profile And We Started Talking And This Was Uh I Think Five Days Ago So I've This Is The It Out It Was It Real Saint In This For About A By Tomorrow I Could Imagine I'll Own.

Placement Is Still An Area Where We Can Send You A Nice Shack Between A Few Hundred Bucks Up Two Hundred Hundred And Fifty Even For An The Artists For Commercial So You Know What He's Doing Is Giving You The Money Did Then Decide Do I Go In The Studio And Make The Best Recording You Know Do I Go And I I You Know Get Everything I Can Do Together For My Roadshow Higher Side Player Higher The Better You Know Make Sure That I Haven't Got Hop Tore Manager And Maybe I Have To You Know Get Him Some Money To Start So So What He'll Do Is Help You Get The Money And Then We Can Assist You'd How To Spend It Believe Me We Can Assist You And How Does That I Believe We're Good It's Spending Money </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: I Would Also Like To Add That If You Are Trying To Build A Career For Yourself As An Artist And You Were Given A Set Amount Of Money What I Would Do Is I Would Try To Expand That Career Like That's What A Lotta People Are Doing In Here And I Would Do It Through Trying To Expand Your Audience Recordings Everyone In This Room Who Knows How To Use A Computer Knows That You Don't Need To Spend What It Costs For A House To Make A Record You Use To I Mean That Was The Way It Was Ten Fifteen Years Ago It Was A Six Figure Investment In The Only People That That Kinda Money We're Labels It's Not True Anymore What Is The Costs Now Is Marketing That Or In The Case Of Of You As An Artist It's Getting Yourself Out There I Would Use That Money Too. Tour Because Touring As Expensive If You Go Up To San Francisco Where You're Not Known It Cost You Money It Costs You Money For Gas It Costs You Money To Stay At A Place It Cost You Money To Do Whatever Used Wisely But That's What Is Crucial For You If You Were Going To Take Money If Somebody's Going To Give You Fifty Or Seventy Five Grand I Would Say That The Most Important Thing For You Is To Build An Audience I Would Say That To Anyone In This </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: Room That Hey Most Important Remember We're No Longer In The Era In The Music Business Of Selling Anything We Would There's Nothing To Sell I Mean This Point Was Made Brilliantly Last Year With Drake One But Three Billion You Downloads And Not A Single Sale And Well I'm I'm Exaggerating But Relative To Three Billion Down But But Uh Streams I Mean As I Get A Minuscule One Twenty Albums Sold Or Something So We're No Longer Selling Anything What You're Selling As Yourself You're Selling You Use The Artist And The Only Thing That Hasn't Value In Exactly Is The Hard Ticket Of Showing Up To See You On That Stage And That Has Real Value That's Where I Would Be Putting The Money Into Taking What It Would Take To Go To Wherever It Where Is Your Bases In San Diego Is In L._a. Or At Least Live Out Here I'm Actually On L._a. Right Now In The Valley Okay Yeah That's What I'm I'm In Sherman Oaks So On As A Am I Would Say Than You Wanna Start Expanding </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: Too You Know Some Of The Other Territories Outside Of L._a. Weather In San Diego Or San Jose Jose Live Or Wherever Yeah Start Building That That's Where I Would Be Using The Money For You As A Career You Can Make Recordings Very Inexpensively Okay And I Would Also Say That One Of The Most Important Things For Someone Like Yourself Who's Trying To Build A Career Who's Going To Do It Through Life Performances In This Goes For Everybody Have Something To Sell At Your Performance Have Merchandise Have C._d.s That You Can Sign At A Booth Afterwards Have Tee Shirts Have Something That People Can Take And You Know Purchased From You That That That Number One It's Smart From A Branding Point Of View Number Two It It's Very Smart From An Economic Point Of View If You're Building A Base And It's Proven The Number One Thing Though What Is It Ninety Percent Any Merchandise Winter Land All Of Them Will Tell You Ninety Percent Include It With Each You Or The Rolling Stones Ninety Percent Of The Merchandise Is Sold At The Concert There Is A Very Very Little Even The Rolling Stones I Mean Maybe Ten Percent Of Their Merchandise Is Sold On Line After The Facts Were Whale After The Event So That's What So So Many Artists Don't Want To Invest Money Into Having Stuff To Sell To Their Audience And I Think That That's A Real Waste Especially If You're Going To Be Touring Use It Huh If You Do Your Math Right You Could Profit Exactly But But Most Important You Can Build Something And And You Can Get Their Email Address You Can You Know You There's Ways Of Utilizing It To Build Your Your Your It's Not Social Media And It's Not Only About Money It's About We're Talking About Building A Career Here And You Asked About How You Would Use That Money To Build The Career That Would Be The Way I Would Say I Would Say That Any Act That The Most Important Thing Is Not Recordings Unless You're You You Have Desires Of Being The Next You Know Beyond Say Or Pop Kind Of Back A Major Label Is The Thing For You Because No One Can Do That As Well As They Can And That's A Very Very Very Expensive Game And The Truth Is They're Offering It To Fewer And Fewer And Fewer And Fewer People That's That's The Reality Of Any Meal You Look At These I Mean I Document This Stuff And It's Like Sony Columbia Records Had A Hundred And Thirty Seven Artists On The Roster Five Years Ago The Only They Have Now Have Less Than Half Mustn't Have Have Sixty Eight </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 8: Wow That That's One Of The Largest Labels In The Business So It It's It's Gone Way Way Way Way Way Down That's The Thing There's Not As Much Money In The Industry I Mean That's Sort Of The Given What's Not Set In That Statement Is That The Labels And All Their Staff Sir Commensurate With Not Having The Same Amount Of Money The Same Thing With Them A Movie Business Disney Warner's </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 3: Ten Years Ago They Used To Put Out Eighteen Movies A Year Disney Cook That The Chairman A Disney Said We're Lucky If We Put Out Nine Or Ten Because We're Putting In Twenty Times The Amount Of Money With One Or Two Hundred Million Over Film But We're Not Putting Eighteen Of 'em Out A Year So It's The Same Thing It's </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: Like You Know When You Talk About Artists Where I Was Saying Before In Las One At The Most Important Thing Today Is To Get People's Attention It's The Hardest Thing To Do And I Think One Of The Best Ways To Do It Is For An Artist Is Through Their Music Too Alive Performance And That's Where I Would Use I Agree And Can Do That </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: Oh One Less Thing Of Our You Actually What He's Saying Is Actually True You're Building Your Bright Like I'm Going To Take A League Should Example But It's True A Brittany Spears Per From New Stores Still Perform In Vegas Wide She Lifts Things That Nobody Goes There To Watch A Perform Life Why She Looks Good She Has The Phenomenon You Know Everybody Wants To Watch Yeah Same With Mariah Carey Why Is That Is The Same Thing And I'm Sorry Forgive Bags We Are Living In That Age You Like I Saw His I Actually Heard Has Song Outcast Unlike Men It's Totally Cool Why Your Personality Your Brand Right You Need To Build Your Brand Your Looks That's Really Important And Owning Your Fans I Keep In Franchising And Every Confidence Own It Don't Give It Away To Face Book Insert Again Because Of The Reality Is You're Working For Them They're Making Money Off Of Your Content They're Making Money Out Of Your Ass They're Not Paying You Anything You Too There Is Another Story There So You And It's Kind Of A Shitty Rural And I'm From The Tech World And I Will Not Take The Blame Because Didn't Create It But It's All About Owning Your Fans Building A Brand You Know And That's Going To Change Everything I This Brand I Watch Are Jazz Totally Jazz And They Sold Out Six Thousand Uh Was Actually A City National In San Jose Six Thousand People There Are Sold Out Why They Want To Watch Them There Are Cool He's Performing And He Makes Most Of His Money Selling Tickets So He's Actually Read Right It's Like So Would You Take It It's All About Your Brian And Owning A Fence Convert Them Convert Get Everything As Much As A Cat Yeah Merchandise Of Course The Number One </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: Yeah You Ever Hear Of Joe Anyone In This Room Heard Idol One Of Them Was A Lot Of People Haven't But He's The Classic Example Of This Uh I Went To A Conference In The Summer That Had His Social Media People There He Started Out With Two Thousand Face Books Hours With The Very Beginning Of His Career No Record Just Through Life Performance Bill Doing It But He Bill He's Now Has Fifteen Albums That He's Produced Himself And He Makes Six Million Bucks A Year But A Lot Of People Haven't Heard Of Him My Point Of Bringing Him Up Is That He's The Classic Ultimate Independent Artist Who Build His Career On His Own And Who Has The Psych Incredible Empty Check 'em Out Just Check Out The Uh The Website Joe Dot Com It's An Incredible Lesson To Any Artists In Terms Of Branding What He Does How He Does It What He Offers His Merge And It's All Owned By Him One Hundred Percent All The Great Rappers Have Done That Look At Look At What's His Name His Real Name Master P. But Percy Forget His Last Name He Started Out That Way Uh Jay Z Started Out That Way I Mean Now These People Were All Moguls And They Own Their Content They Own Their Brown You Know They're Not Beholden To Someone Else But That's That's The Thing About It You There's There's A Lot Of Examples You Can Use And Look Toward That Was The Only Point Am I Am Making Toward Flus Drink Lower Than Goes Yeah That's Really Straightforward Thank You Go To Young Link You. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 14: It Was It Was Kind Of Are Going Off Of What He Said Be You Are Talking About Like Standing Near Career Through Touring And Em How Major Labels Or What Take It To The Next Level I Think That Our Eyes When This Ad Appreciate Of What You Said About Expanding Through Joying Grading That You Know Ground Four Fan Base Because There's People Like The Weekend Who Started Off That Way And Now He's On A Major Any Like Beyond Any Do The Beyond Say Canada The Not Beyond Anything By Philip Kind Of Like What You Said He's Doing The The Pop Thing But He Was He Was Very Independent You Know And Be All That Stuff For Now And Then He Tore All Year Now I </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: Know His Story Very I'm Very Well And He He Did It The Right Way I Mean And And It Took Three Albums Yes No Evolved War And He Gave Them Away For Free Mhm Teachers Posted The First One On The Internet The Second One Of The But Any It Never Performed But Built That Bays If Steadily Steadily Steadily And The Thing That Helped Him Was Someone As He Built That Base Someone In Camp Said To I Heard The Sky And The Connection Was He's From Toronto And Drake Is From Toronto They're Both Canadians Who Said You Should Check 'em Out And Drink Did Whoever The Trusted I Don't Know Who That Trusted Source But Dragged Did Check Them Out And Treated About Him And That Really Was The Thing That Helped Catapulted Him To That Next Level It Didn't Make Him A Star But It Helped Get The Attention To Where I Think Universal Took Those Three Albums Bundled Them And They Were Already Given Away For Free But At That's Another Great Example Of The Modern Way In Which It's Done Where The Concept And This Is An Important One For Artists The Concept Of Giving Something Away For Free In Hopes Of Getting You To Buy Something Else Prince Understood That Concept Yes I Mean Years Ago He Gave Away His Album For Free If You Bought A Concert Tickets In K. Either That An England To Eat A Twenty One Night The O. Two Arena He Gave Away The Album For For You Got An Album When You Walked In The Door The C._d. Came As Everybody Gave Their Ticket And The Distributors In England Freaked And When He Was And He Did What It Was Called The Cover Melt He Put The C._d. On The Cover Of The Sunday Paper And When They Asked Him Because The Agreement Was He'll Do An Interview With The Paper In Changed For That Three Point Eight Million Copies And They Said Why Are You Doing This He Said Because We're A Couple Of Reasons This Showed Me How Bright He Was He Said For An Artist At The Stage Of Their Life And Career Than I Am At If I Did At The Traditional Way At Best I Would Say In England Forty To Fifty Two Thousand Copies At Best Okay If I Did At The Traditional Way This Way Three Point Eight Million People Were Getting My New C._d. Who Knows This Was A Courtroom Him Maybe They'll Buy A Concert Tickets Maybe They'll Buy Some Merchandise Maybe The Like The Music And Check Out My Previous Catalogue Pay The Come To A Show I Mean Whatever It Was He Felt That It Was Giving Something Away For Free In Hopes Of Getting You To Buy It Something Else It's Such An Important Concept Today That I Think Really Neat You Know This Idea Of By By By What Are We Selling Today Every Every R. S. Everything Has To Really Think That And What It Is The Answer Is Themselves Not The Record Not The Sit Nobody Cares It's All You Know It's All Free Anyway So By The </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 14: Brand It's Not Necessarily You Know Is Not Necessarily Records And All That Because I'm John Building Does Does The Same Thing You Put Out Three Makes Sense For Free And Now He's Finally Doing Stuff With Billboard But He Had Built That Fan Base By Touring Around John Who John Belly Any This New Eason In You Know Yet Beg Megan Love John. Yep Beautiful Now Yeah In Megan Loves John Billion Twos But I Just Wanted Use That As It Is An Example Because He Put Out Three Free Mix Tape Gain Guarded A Fan Base Toward All Round Then He Signed Is Deal And Actually You Know He Signed The Deal And And Then Said I Want To Put These Upper Free Like He He Made Chose A Stipulation Is Contracts Artists Want That There Was A Good Point That You Made. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 9: The Other Important Point About What You're Talking About Is Anybody Who Builds A Fan Base. From Alive Perspective It's My Experience That They Will Always Have A Career Okay They Always Will Have A John Most People Don't Others John Mayor Had A Very Large Fan Base Before He Got His Record Deal He Got A Deal On A Small Independent Label Called Aware Records Out To Chicago Before Columbia Picked Him Up With The Very First Room For Squares Album He Had Done That Album Essentially Eight Songs Of It They Ask Them To Write For Five More For The Debut My Point Is That He Had An Enormous Fan Base The Second Album He Did Was A Double Live Album Who Does A Double I've Album For Their Second Album Unless They Have That Strong Fan Base Point Being Anyone In This Room Think Of An Artist That You've Discovered On Record And Fallen In Love With Any Point In Your Life You Found A C._d. An Artist You Fell In Love With It Went To See The Act Live And They Were Terrible. Okay I See Some Of You Have Had That Experience My Experience Tells Me That Artist Stopped Becoming A Career Artist For You You Are Not Automatically Buying There Next Record You Were Not It Was Going To Take A Miracle To Get You To Go To Their Show Again Okay But You Take The Same Scenario You're Talking About A Building That Whether It's Mixed Tapes Or Whatever And Going To See Them Live Falling In Love With Them Going To See Them Lie For The First Time And There Are Better Than The Record My Experience Tells Me That Artist As The Started Becoming A Career Artist For You You'll Forgive Them A Bad Album You'll Be There When The Next One Comes Out You Will Buy Those Tickets To That Show You Will By That Merchandise You Will Purchase The Vinyl Records Even Though You Don't Own A Turntable Okay Because You're A Fan Of That Artist And When You Have That When You Truly Have That Records Don't Matter That's What I've Learned Don't Believe Me Look At The Many Many Many Myriad Of Acts From The From Sixty Seventies Eighties Nineties Who Don't Make Records Anymore Or Have Hit Who Are Still Performing Every Single Night For Huge You Know From Seven Hundred Seats To Fifty Thousand Seats In All I Mean The Rolling Stones Haven't Had Hits And Thirty Five Years But They're Still Selling Out People At Much Lower Levels Are Still Doing It So That's Why The I Think Today It's So Important It's So Important Because Recordings Don't Mean Anything Money Wise Anymore I Mean Truly They Don't Unless You're Taylor Swift Or Or A Dell Who Are Too Out Liars Of The Paradigm That We Live In Today Truly They Are I Mean They're Blessed In They're Very Fortunate But They're Out Liars Of A It's Like The Joke In The Business Today Is Two Million Is The New Ten That's What Everybody Says Two Million Is Newton Because That's What A Lot Of The Superstars Like Weekend Like Beyond Say Like Jay Z That's What They Sell One Point Eight To Two Million. So Anyway Long Winded Answer To Your Own Bankruptcy While But It Is A Good It's A Good Went </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: Ah So Any Other Questions And Then I Think We're Going To Wrap For Lunch Right. Yeah We're All Hungry Ad And These Guys Okay Go Ahead </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 12: And You Said Uh What Is Very Strong To Own Your Photos So And Face Or In All These You Know They Don't Make Money Off Of View And How Do You Do That Necessarily Obviously You Have Your Own Website In So That Could Be Year Photos And Everything Like That But Um 'cause I Know Too That You Could Also Make Money With Graham By Teeming Up With A Company That You You Know Hey I'm Using This New Facial Cream No They'll Pay You Depending On How Many Followers You Have Amount Of Money As Well So Is That Like You Know Kind Of How You Would Team Up So You're Not Being Used As An Artist By Them Or </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: I I'm Pretty Upper New Transferred For That Two Questions One Was Advertising You Don't So How Book Works As Many Of You May Know Or May Not Know When You Give Your Content There You Don't Own It People Other People Are Advertising Face Book Has A Photo Recognition Technology Which Can Really Tell What's There In The Photo Right So They're Making Money Off Of That Who Is Viewing And And Everything Right Now One Avenue Do We Do That No We Have No Interest In Doing That Because We Have A Simple Revenue Model Three Dollars Boom You Have A Channel And What We Know Is Spans Of Already Gone Burn Answering A Second Question Right People Who Are They're Making A Good Living Right Now It's As A Speak I I Look So We Were Trying To Figure That Out That Industry Out And They're More Than Fifty Influence Or Companies You Know How Many How Many Of Them Actually Shut Down Last Year. Thirty And How Many Of Them Are Surviving Five Fifteen Of Them Are Struggling They're Going To Shut Down This Year Will Why Because What What Does Fans And Followers Meat On Face Book It's The Ego Number Or Harming If You're Able To Sell Tickets Do Hundred Out Of Hundred Thousand Okay That's Decent But Only One Percent Actually Seeing A Content Who Remember You Right So You Have To Link All Of That Out Right Ram Is Cool You Have A Lot Of Followers You Probably Are Getting Forty Three Likes When You Have Around I'm Just Guessing Hundred Thousand Right That's The Number But What Dislikes Meet Them Right It's It's Nothing Oh I'm Working With Them They Have One Point Five Million Fans On Fifth Book They Have Forty Three Lax On Their Content. And You Gotta Be Kidding Me Right And So When You See That For Us It's Very Simple I Build This Because I'm A Fan I Didn't Build It For Any Of Their Agenda Right And So For Me Is Like Oh Let's Give Them All A Channel We Can Survive As A Company Thirty Dollars You Know And That That For Us Is Going To Grow Number Right Millions Of People To Go Outgoing More Than One Avenue Fans Are Getting More Engage Because If Someone Likes You And Also Some Of Them Likes Megan Trainer You Know You Don't Have To Worry About It Now That Is He Going To See My Content Because They Will Right Too It's Like Going To The Fan And It's So Hard To Get In Touch With Them Third Question You In That Like There Was There A Little Bit More Winning Friends Yeah When You Own Fans On One Avenue You Get All Their Email You Get All Big Content We Don't Do Anything With It We Are Not Making You Pay To Show Content Like Free As Is Because It Online Right And And Through Gram Now Soon What's Up So Did I Answer A Question </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 12: Yeah You Know Like How Do You Own Last Year Things Like For Me It For Instance I Own I'm A At Me Now And So The Other Things Which Has Gray But As Far As My Photos And I Have To Use Like In Ceramic All Of A Social Media Stuff Right Now Because I'm The Position Where I'm Not Yet You Know Huge Enough For I Don't Have To Have Or I Don't Even Know How The Works For Me Because All The Major Stars Too They're All In In Than You To Been To It Or So It Can </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 6: So So Right Now What Were You Doing Is Weird Transitioning All Of It Throw Free Is The One Is You Connect Your Channel Re Aggregate All Of The Content You Don't Have To Post Dark To One Avenue So That's A Transition Face You Still Only A Photo Right Now We Are Are Passed Through Right But The Good Part Is Owning Your Fans Selling More Tickets Modify Music All In Their Face Right That's Great The Second Thing Which Is Coming Along Is Actually Posting You Post Your Tracks From Spot Of Fire Let Your Fans Now Right Invite Your Friends To Sell It Tickets Were Building That Up Right And His Posting More Beer Cart And Within One Avenue But Not Only To One Avenue But It Also Goes Out Your Face Book Is Going To Go Out To Answer Grams Lab Chat Toward Our Rip Partnering With All Of Them So Then You Actually Use One Avenue Now It's Up To You Who You Want A Gift Content To In Our Platform You On The Content If You Push It Did Them It's Up To You Giving Them The Rights Right. </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 2: All Right We're Gonna Break For Lunch You Want A Hand Me A Microphone We're Going To Break For Lunch Now Please Feel Free To Walk Up To These Guys And It Cost Them And Ask Them That Million Questions Alright Thank You Or Let's Heard </p><p style='font-family:"Calibri",Arial,Verdana;font-size:11pt;'>Speaker 5: Forum.
